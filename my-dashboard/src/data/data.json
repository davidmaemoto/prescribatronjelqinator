He is a 71-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife 2 years ago for a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, and left frontal, left parietal and right temporal metastases. At the time of his last followup visit on 03/08/2013, imaging showed interval development of at least 28 new enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, and increased enhancement of the previously treated clival lesion. Mr. Roemer received whole-brain radiation therapy at Sequoia Regional Cancer Center, completed on 04/05/2025. He has noted left arm tingling for the last few months, and increasing left arm weakness for the last month. The arm weakness became much more pronounced last week. He can no longer lift the left arm, but maintains grip strength. He continues dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily, which was recently decreased from 4 mg 3 times daily. While on dexamethasone, he has developed  bilateral lower extremity weakness with difficulty climbing stairs, and significant edema. Mr. Roemer further reports ear fullness and difficulty hearing since completion of whole brain radiation therapy, and an increase in his longstanding double vision this morning. He denies additional neurologic complaints. A head CT was obtained last weekend, reportedly showing no acute changes. A brain MRI was repeated at Stanford Hospital today, formal report pending.     He continues systemic management with everolimus and is scheduled  for followup in the medical oncology clinic this Thursday.    Allergies: NKDA.    Medications: Cosopt, Epogen, folic acid, allopurinol, aspirin, Coreg, everolimus, hydralazine, Imdur, Xalatan ophthalmic drops, Synthroid, Mycostatin.    Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man with a cushingoid appearance in no acute distress. KPS 60. Temperature 36.2, respirations 17, pulse 80, blood pressure 171/91. HEENT: Normocephalic, alopecic, extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx clear. He is hard of hearing. Neck: Supple. Breathing unlabored. Extremities: Left hand with edema, skin discoloration, and a scab in the region of the 5th metacarpal. Bilateral pitting lower extremity edema extending to the thigh. Neurologic Examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact. Motor strength 3/5 left deltoid, 4/5 left biceps and triceps, 5/5 left wrist, grip and finger extension. Bilateral hip flexors 4/5. Strength otherwise 5/5 bilaterally. Sensation decreased to light touch left upper extremity. He has difficulty arising from a seated to standing position. Gait steady.    Laboratory Data: 04/06/2013: WBC 14.1, RBC 4.11, hemoglobin 11.2, hematocrit 36.3, albumin 3.3, sodium 143, potassium 5.2, creatinine 1.3, BUN 79.    Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the brain which was completed earlier today. When compared to prior imaging from 03/07/2013, there has been interval decrease in edema with stable size of numerous intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastases are identified.    Summary: Nicky Roemer is a 71-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the brain and skull base, who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery 2 years ago and whole brain radiation therapy last week, and now presents with increasing left upper extremity weakness. A brain MRI was repeated earlier today, which did not explain the increasing arm weakness. On the MRI, vasogenic  edema was improved, no new metastases were identified, and the previously seen metastases were stable. He will be sent for a cervical spine MRI today.    It is unclear if the steroids are exacerbating the left upper extremity weakness, and a slow Decadron taper will be initiated. We also recommend that he present to the Stanford ED for further evaluation of the left hand wound. He will try decongestants to help with the ear fullness and hearing loss post WBRT. We will follow up with Mr. Roemer after the C-spine MRI.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Nicky Roemer. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.     Sincerely,      Laurie Krishnamoorthy Santoso, NP    Iris Steinhauer Xiao, MD  Associate Professor  Radiation Oncology  _______    I, Iris Mcvey Heuer, MD, saw and examined the patient and participated in all aspects of this patient's evaluation and management, including history, physical exam, review of laboratory studies, and discussion of findings and plan with the family.  I have reviewed the above note, have edited it where needed, and agree with the  assessment and plan.     Attending Narrative: 71 yr old man with brain metastases of renal cell cancer.  He was treated with Cyberknife 2 years ago,but earlier this year developed more diffuse brain metastases and was referred for whole brain irradiation.  This course was completed a last week.  Currently he has a new issue of nearly flaccid dysfunction of the left upper extremity.  Today's MRI does not show progression of the brain lesions.  However, it appears that he has recurrent infection of the left hand.  We will send him to the ED for further evaluation. Perhaps a c-spine MRI may help clarify if there are other sources to explain the new clinical findings.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up today on sutent.    Oncology History:  The patient is a 70 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Pilgrim Bedi 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell  carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Ebrahim Giannotti/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.     Review of Systems: Overall tolerating sutent. He is noticing more side effects during week 3 and week 4.Mild sores on his feet which have now resolved during the rest weeks. His hands are sunburned bilaterally from golfing. Has also notice easy bruising on his hands and forearms. No epistaxis, melena, or hematuria. He has stable diplopia when he is tired at night. After ENT consult at Stanford in early 10/04/2011 hearing aides were recommended; he is now wearing hearing aides bilaterally. He has liquid nasal discharge in the mornings, which resolves quickly. No recent fever, chills, sinus tenderness, headaches. Some moderate fatigue, but he is playing golf occasionally. He has noticed easy cuts/bruising on his forearms.

Thakur 2-ABNORMAL, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED    PET SEQUENCE: Response to therapy: Partial response      Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Koo for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Drs. Chang and Gibbs saw him in February and is happy with his continued response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior nasopharynx that has remained stable for some time, and encompasses the eustachian tube. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time.He will see him in May with another MRI of brain.    PLAN:  - Change sutent to 2 weeks on/1 week off to see if side effects are more tolerable.  - Counseled on good skin care and wearing sunscreen  - RTC in 6 weeks for Sivaraman, MD zometa or prn  - Will also follow-up with Dr. Carmona as scheduled on 04/07/2012 or prn  - Call in the interim with any problems or questions    The patient plan was discussed with Sandy  Lunn, MD  Woerner Boudreau, NP 03/17/2012   I have reviewed the history of present illness, personally confirmed the interval history, social history, complete 14 pt ROS, physical examination, laboratory and radiology studies and agree with the documentation in the note above.

Diff colitis who was admitted with hypercalcemia.    Reason for Hospitalization: Hypercalcemia    Hospital Course/Significant Findings:     Mr. Burd Dunson admitted after labs from the outpatient heart failure clinic demonstrated a calcium of 12.1 (corrected to 13.4 by albumin), AKI (Cr 2.4) and possible hemoconcentration. He had been feeling poorly for the past two weeks with low energy but no specific complaints. He had received zoledronic acid in the past, most recently on 10/22/2012.    In the hospital he was treated with NS IV fluids, calcitonin and pamindronate.  His calcitriol and Lasix were held upon admission and were not continued on discharge. He will restart the lasix 20 mg PO in one week.     At discharge, he felt that he remained generally weaker than his baseline. He plans to continue to follow up with PT/OT.  At discharge his ionized calcium was 1.38 and his total calcium had trended down to 9.3.  His creatinine returned to 1.6 at discharge.    Per Dr. Knepper, Mr. Burd Warren reduce his dose of pazopanib to 400mg daily upon discharge.    He was discharged with a plan to not take his lasix for the rest of the week, but to restart it in one week, or if he begins to have symptoms of heart failure which were reviewed with the patient. He will follow up with the heart failure clinic in one to two weeks and he will contact the clinic if he has any symptoms of volume overload.    He was discharged after meeting with Dr.  Srinivas with a plan to have his calcium and general labs checked in one week near his home.  He will fax the results to Dr. Barry and he will plan to follow up with a local oncologist, Dr. Bunnell Albertson Visalia to arrange to be able to get therapy and transfusions closer to home when and if needed.

Onc Hx:69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denies weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. He saw his ophthalmologist who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Negron Fusco 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal  head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     XThe patient's left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Madson Remington/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT:    Cyberknife:  Tumor #1 was his clivus metastasis. This was treated with 27.5 Gy delivered to the 80% isodose line using a 15 and 20 mm collimator over 5 sessions. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 34.38 Gy. The volume treated was 30. 73 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 38 x 49 x 38 mm.   Tumor #2 was a left frontal metastasis. This was treated with 24 Gy delivered to the 79% isodose line in a single session. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 30.38 Gy. The volume treated was 0.307 mL, treated lesion dimensions were 8 x 10 x 7 mm.   Tumor #3 was a left parietal metastasis. This was treated with 24 Gy delivered to the 84% isodose line in a single session. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 28.57 Gy. The volume treated was 0.08 mL and treated lesion dimensions were 5 x 5 x 5 mm.   Tumor #4 was a right temporal lobe metastasis. This was treated with 24 Gy delivered to the 85% isodose line in a single session. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 28.24 Gy delivered through a 7.5 mm collimator. The volume treated was 0.08 mL, treated lesion dimensions were 5 x 6 x mm. The patient tolerated his procedure well. I have ordered a followup MRI scan of his brain including a skull base protocol in 3 months.     Interval History: Pt seen as a new pt on 02/14/2011 and was given Sutent and is here for followup. Statrted Sutent on 02/22/2011. Pt received prophylactic palliative external beam radiotherapy to his left femoral neck at Stanford from 3/2 to 02/25/2011.

He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Frenkel for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Last clinic visit: 01/04/2012.  Still getting blood-tinged runny nose mostly in the morning.  Not on any nasal or sinus regimen.  Has intermittent let diplopia, but since his pacemaker placement 2 weeks ago, the diplopia seems to have resolved on its own.  Also has right hearing loss, wearing hearing aid.

He is a 69-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastases to the skull base and brain 8 months ago. Specifically, a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastasis was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025-8th, 2011. He was last seen in followup in this department on 07/04/2011 at which time he was radiographically stable.    A repeat MRI of the skull base was performed earlier today. The formal radiology report is pending. Additionally, a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed today, and he is planning to discuss the results with Dr. Ehrlich Schilling the medical oncology department tomorrow. He continues Sutent, which he is tolerating well.    Symptomatically, Mr. Marchese continues to report occasional episodes of diplopia noted when looking to the far left. He has known bilateral middle ear/mastoid effusions and underwent a recent audiogram, showing bilateral mixed hearing loss, primarily conductive. It was recommended that he treat the hearing loss conservatively with hearing aids before considering PE tube placement. He also reports cold intolerance, currently is maintained on Synthroid 50 mcg daily and underwent a repeat TSH today, with an elevated result of 6.14. He further reports that his skin is thin and tears easily the past 4 months. He denies additional complaints. The pain within the left hip and leg has completely resolved.    Allergies: NKDA.    Medications: Coreg,  nystatin oral suspension, Pepcid, Synthroid, lisinopril, Zometa, Protonix, Sutent, Cosopt ophthalmic drops, Xalatan Ophthalmic Drops, Norvasc.    Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man in no acute distress. KPS 80. Temperature 36.9, pulse 53, blood pressure 153/83. Weight 83.6 kg. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx clear. He is wearing hearing aids bilaterally. Neck supple. Breathing unlabored. Skin warm and dry, with bruising to the right hand and forearm. Neurologic Examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact to detailed testing. Motor strength 5/5 within the upper and lower extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Gait steady. Tandem walk intact.    Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier today, which was compared to prior imaging from 07/04/2011 and 02/14/2011. The treated left frontal metastasis is barely seen on the current examination (series 12, image 25). The treated right temporal and left parietal metastases are no longer seen. The nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous metastasis remains stable. Mastoid disease has increased since February, and is slightly worse when compared to imaging performed in July. No new intracranial metastatic disease is identified. Review of today's CT scan shows the left femoral neck metastasis has interval subtle improvement.    Summary: Tomas Marchese is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal carcinoma who remains radiographically stable 8 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are identified. Symptomatically, he continues to report occasional episodes of diplopia when looking to the far left, though has no new neurologic complaints. We have asked that he return to this clinic with  a repeat MRI in 3 months. In the interim, he will follow up with the medical oncology department tomorrow to discuss the results of today's CT scan. Additionally he states that his Synthroid is managed by the medical oncology department, and will discuss the elevated TSH result with him tomorrow.

Witteles said you could go up on the amlodipine to 10 mg daily . This is double the dose of 5 mg daily that you currently take. Please let me know if you need a prescription refill. Dr Witteles did not comment on the fatigue and I think it may be a good idea to check with your oncologist to see if this is an expected side effect of the pazopanib. Since Dick just had the fluid removed from his lungs I'm not sure this is the cause of the fatigue.  If he has signs that the fluid is back such as worsening shortness of breath, chest discomfort, rapid breathing, the fatigue could certainly be related to fluid.  Please let us know if things don't change and let us know how his blood pressure responds to the increase in amlodipine.

He checked it Monday and today.. and it seems to be of concern.  Monday, 11/22/2025 it was 145/82m and tonight it was 170/105. (Not good).  He has not been exercising at all - mostly sitting and sleeping.  We don't know if his lack of energy is due to the Fluid on his lungs, the procedure or the new medicine (Pazopanib) that he started on 11/20/2025.    He had a blood test done today and the Visalia Medical Clinic should be sending it to you.     Thank you for your help.

As noted below, after the clinic and after I received his laboratory reports I sent him to the emergency room for admission.     Since I had last seen him 2 weeks prior, he has overall done poorly. He did have the thoracentesis which did provide him significant relief of dyspnea. 3.5 L was removed of apparently mildly red fluid. No biochemical testing was  done on it other than a cytology which was negative for malignancy. He was started by Dr. Morataya Ortez pazopanib, which he was on for about 10 days, but felt quite poorly including profound fatigue and recently some worsening of his loose stools again (of course, with a recent history of Clostridium difficile infection, status post 2 treatment courses). His blood pressures on the pazopanib have also been on the higher side, mainly 140s to 160s over 90s.     He did switch his hydrochlorothiazide to Lasix as instructed last time with complete resolution of his edema. His appetite has overall been quite poor and his biggest complaint was of profound fatigue.     Current medications, physical examination are as documented in the Epic documentation below. Comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     Interrogation of his Medtronic pacemaker shows that he is atrially sensed 47% of the time, ventricularly paced 41% of the time. He has episodes that are marked on the AT/AF zone which were actually far field sensing and we, therefore, decrease the sensitivity to prevent the incorrect mode switching.                 Overall, I was quite concerned about Mr. Cramer appearance. He appeared, if anything, dry on exam and the blood pressure was a bit up today, though he did not have a dose of pazopanib today, and I had him continue the increased amlodipine dose which was already at 10 mg a day, and planned to increase his carvedilol to 12.5 mg b.i.d. He did have exam evidence of pleural effusion as well. I talked to him about the fact that I thought that the cause of his effusion was fairly unlikely to be heart failure given the unilateral nature and the quick development of it as well his present effusion without being volume overloaded. I noted that though the cytology was negative, this by no means discounted malignancy as the cause, and he had an appointment the following day to  meet with Dr. Crisostomo Of note, he had lost 25 pounds of weight since I last saw him just a couple weeks ago, some of which was clearly related to fluid, but some of which was clearly related to loss of muscle mass as well, with my great concern that this could reflect a rapidly worsening malignancy which would go along with his effusion as well. I checked labs after clinic which were notable for a very elevated calcium of 12.1 with an albumin of 2.4. His BUN and creatinine were 40 and 2.3 respectively, which was a slight increase in his creatinine from his baseline. Of note, his calcium in November was 9.6, and on 10/12/2025 was 8.9. I suspect that the hypercalcemia is related to his malignancy and likely the result of bony metastases that he is known to have. I called him and told him to go to the emergency room and gave the emergency room information about his coming, and also spoke with the oncology fellow to let him know of Mr. Clemons impending visit to the emergency room. I tried to contact Dr. Tupa but she was unavailable by page. I will follow him up as appropriate, of course, once he leaves the hospital, but I do not believe heart failure is the main issue at this point. Of note, he did have an echo today which showed that his EF has further decreased, though only mildly further with an EF that was read as 29%, down from 41% in August. Visually I do not believe that the fall has been this dramatic. I think that part of the fall is likely from dyssynchrony from his RV pacing, as well as some from his preexistent LV dysfunction with a very possible component from his tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Nevertheless, again I think that his main cause of illness is less likely the heart failure and much more likely his progressive malignancy.

Since I last saw him in August, he has had  several active medical issues. He was hospitalized from 10/05/2025 to 10/08/2025 in the setting of dehydration and volume depletion, which happened in the setting of significant diarrhea that he had been having. We had actually been following his labs and noticed an acute rise in his creatinine and called him and learned of his diarrhea and in this setting advised that he go to the emergency room. At that time he was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and started on metronidazole for an original 10-day course. At that point, his sunitinib was also discontinued and he has remained off of it since that time. He was hydrated and discharged on the 19th. His diarrhea had gotten better, but then returned on 10/22/2025 in the setting of having been off of his Flagyl for few days.   He therefore was restarted on a course on 10/28/2025, which is a 3 week course, which he will be completing in 1 more day. He said that his bowel movements got much better once again on this, though this morning he had his first loose stool in some time.     Also since the hospitalization in October, he has had significant edema, which appears to have occurred in the setting of the volume repletion. His cardiac medications have also been stopped in the setting of his volume depletion and gradually added back such that for about 2 weeks he has been on amlodipine 10 mg daily and carvedilol 6.25 mg b.i.d. He has not had any issues with his pacemaker and gets this monitored locally.     He had a PET/CT performed here on 10/22/2025. This revealed a new hypermetabolic hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe concerning for new metastasis. He had stable 2 cm non-FDG avid nodules in the left lower lobe, and development of a few new right upper lobe punctate nodules as well as increased number of nodular opacities at the right lung base, some of which had mild activity and appeared to be infectious/inflammatory. He had a stable lytic lesion  in the left femoral neck with mild FDG activity felt to be likely related to post radiation changes and focal increased FDG activity overlying the left longissimus capitis muscle, which was felt to be likely physiologic, but cannot exclude malignancy. In the body of the report it is also noted that there was a new subtle focus of increased FDG uptake in the right posterior pleura. Notably, on that CT scan, he had an increased size of what was still a small right-sided pleural effusion and a trace effusion on the left.     Mr. Laughlin says that he overall feels quite fatigued and has been having significant dyspnea on exertion. He does not feel like he has recovered well the last couple of months and feels like he is getting weaker, with the exception, again, of the fact that the diarrhea was improved with the Flagyl.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented in the EPIC documentation below, comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     Labs from 11/16/2025 include white count of 7.2, hematocrit of 30, platelets of 302,000, sodium 142, potassium 4.7, BUN and creatinine of 37 and 1.6 respectively. A recent urine microalbumin was 300 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine.     I was concerned based on my exam at that visit that he likely had a large right pleural effusion. This was not seen on the PET/CT earlier in the month, and I ordered a chest x-ray, which he had performed after the clinic, which indeed confirmed a new large right pleural effusion associated with mild right-to-left mediastinal shift. A underlying consolidation and/or mass cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung was clear with a small left pleural effusion.       I also, based on his clear volume overload, stopped hydrochlorothiazide and replaced it with Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. with plans for labs in 1 week, and I lowered his amlodipine from 10 mg daily to 5 mg daily. As his blood  pressure is reasonably controlled, he is not getting adequate PPI therapy, and there is a chance that the amlodipine is contributing to the edema.     Clearly, the biggest issue right now is this new large pleural effusion. I called Dr. Stowers after he the chest x-ray results, and her office will coordinate with Mr. Laughlin Youngs get it tapped and appropriate evaluation.   Though he does have volume overload, given the unilateral nature of it, it's size and rapid development, and the recent PET findings, I suspect that it most likely will be malignant in origin and, of course, defer the management of that to Dr. Vanness Again, of note, he has also been off of his Sutent since his hospitalization in October. He knows to call Dr.   Fitzpatrick Yao if his diarrhea recurs.     I will plan to have him return to this clinic in 2 weeks' time with an echo and in the interim Dr. West Campana be following up with him for the reasons above.     Thank you for allowing me to take part in the care of Mr. Laughlin Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in his care.    In summary, I believe the majority of Mr. Buford lesions represent senile purpura. These lesions are likely exaccerbated by his mild thrombocytopenia and chemotherapy. Additionally, there is a second morphology of lesions on the upper arm. It is  likely that these lesions occurred during his pacemaker implantation procedure and are in their process of resolving. I would like to follow Mr. Mcmasters Rawal ensure that these lesions continue to improve and that the more typical senile purpura on his arms remain stable over time.    Below please find the note from my evaluation (with a medical student). If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.    Should you have any needs regarding this or other patients you have referred to Stanford, please contact the Stanford Referring Physician Resource Center at (866) 742-4811.

Mr. Mcmasters is currently being treated for metastatic RCC with sunitinib. He has been on this therapy for 18mo.     Mr. Mcmasters notes that he has had easy bruising and bleeding from his forearms for the last 6mo. He denies itching or pain from the lesions on his forearms. He reports that the lesions have actually been improving and that they look \"the best they have over the last 3mo\" today. He does report that his skin has been \"drier\" recently and he has been  using cetaphil lotion. He reports that he has not used this recently as he and his wife have had house guests recently and have been busy with grandchildren.     Mr. Mcmasters also reports bruising of his chest that has been present for the last 5 weeks, ever since he had his pacemaker placed.     Mr. Elkins Harrah platelets in June of this year were 101. He denies coumadin or ASA use. He denies the use of herbal supplements including Vitamin E, ginko, ginger, garlic and St. John's wart.     Mr. Mcmasters does have a long hx of sun exposure as he worked outside when he lived in IL. He continues to participate in outdoor activities such as golf. He does not use sunscreen.

Danielle Tartar, PhD  MS4  I served as a scribe for Dr. Nall Clerck during this encounter.     PE: Exam of scap, face, neck, arms, back, chest, abdomen, and legs    - Background erythema with moderate scale of dorsal forearms b/l   - Non-blanching purpura of forearms, worse on dorsal surface but including palmar surface as well   - Scattered, non-blanching petechiae of upper arms and  sun-exposed areas on back   Assessment and Plan:   1. Senile Purpura   - Likely secondary to hx of sun exposure, aging, and relatively low current plt levels   - Benign lesions, reassurance provided   - Advised sun protection including daily SPF 30 or greater sun screen     - there are two morphologies to the lesions: more typical senile purpura on the dorsal hands and forearms with some smaller, deeply erythematous macules on the upper arms. Given the recent pacemaker procedure, I favor that the atypical lesions are a result of BP cuff trauma and resulting increased distal pressures. I would like to check on the progress of all the lesions over the next 6 weeks to ensure that these are resolving. The typical senile purpura will like persist and are likely  exaccerbated due to the mildly decreased platelet count and chemotherapy effect. Nonetheless, this is not a worrisome process at its current state.    2. Background Actinic Damage to forearms   - Advised daily sun protection   - Advised daily use of Amlactin cream or lotion   - Advised pt to d/c \"picking\" of areas on arms for evaluation at last visit.     -if not improved significantly, will discuss efudex therapy/aldara or LN2 if only local after resolution of the xerosis.

Since I last saw him in August, he has had several active medical issues. He was hospitalized from 10/05/2025 to 10/08/2025 in the setting of dehydration and volume depletion, which happened in the setting of significant diarrhea that he had been having. We had actually been following his labs and noticed an acute rise in his creatinine and called him and learned of his diarrhea and in this setting advised that he go to the emergency room. At that time he was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and started on metronidazole for an original 10-day course. At that point, his sunitinib was also discontinued and he has remained off of it since that time. He was hydrated and discharged on the 19th. His diarrhea had gotten better, but then returned on 10/22/2025 in the setting of having been off of his Flagyl for few days. He therefore was restarted on a course on 10/28/2025, which is a 3 week course, which he will be completing in 1 more day. He said that his bowel movements got much better once again on this, though this morning he had his first loose stool in some time.     Also since the hospitalization in October, he has had significant edema, which appears to have occurred in the setting of the volume repletion. His cardiac medications have also been stopped in the setting of his volume depletion and  gradually added back such that for about 2 weeks he has been on amlodipine 10 mg daily and carvedilol  6.25 mg b.i.d. He has not had any issues with his pacemaker and gets this monitored locally.     He had a PET/CT performed here on 10/22/2025. This revealed a new hypermetabolic hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe concerning for new metastasis. He had stable 2 cm non-FDG avid nodules in the left lower lobe, and development of a few new right upper lobe punctate nodules as well as increased number of nodular opacities at the right lung base, some of which had mild activity and appeared to be infectious/inflammatory. He had a stable lytic lesion in the left femoral neck with mild FDG activity felt to be likely related to post radiation changes and focal increased FDG activity overlying the left longissimus capitis muscle, which was felt to be likely physiologic, but cannot exclude malignancy. In the body of the report it is also noted that there was a new subtle focus of increased FDG uptake in the right posterior pleura. Notably, on that CT scan, he had an increased size of what was still a small right-sided pleural effusion and a trace effusion on the left.     Mr. Gerdes says that he overall feels quite fatigued and has been having significant dyspnea on exertion. He does not feel like he has recovered well the last couple of months and feels like he is getting weaker, with the exception, again, of the fact that the diarrhea was improved with the Flagyl.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented in the EPIC  documentation below, comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     Labs from 11/16/2025 include white count of 7.2, hematocrit of 30, platelets of 302,000, sodium 142, potassium 4.7, BUN and creatinine of 37 and 1.6 respectively. A recent urine microalbumin was 300 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine.     I was concerned based on my exam at that visit that he likely had a large right pleural effusion. This was not seen on the  PET/CT earlier in the month, and I ordered a chest x-ray, which he had performed after the clinic, which indeed confirmed a new large right pleural effusion associated with mild right-to-left mediastinal shift. A underlying consolidation and/or mass cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung was clear with a small left pleural effusion. I also, based on his clear volume overload, stopped hydrochlorothiazide and replaced it with Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. with plans for labs in 1 week, and I lowered his amlodipine from 10 mg daily to 5 mg daily. As his blood pressure is reasonably controlled, he is not getting adequate PPI therapy, and there is a chance that the amlodipine is contributing to the edema.     Clearly, the biggest issue right now is this new large pleural effusion. I called Dr. Connolly after he the chest x-ray results, and her office will coordinate with Mr. Gerdes Doe get it tapped and appropriate evaluation. Though he does have volume overload, given the unilateral nature of it, it's size and rapid development, and the recent PET findings, I suspect that it most likely will be malignant in origin and, of course, defer the management of that to Dr. Supnet Again, of note, he has also been off of his Sutent since his hospitalization in October. He knows to call Dr. Vilchez Chandra if his diarrhea recurs.    I will plan to have him return to this clinic in 2 weeks' time with an echo and in the interim Dr. Lederer Malladi be following up with him for the reasons above.     Thank you for allowing me to take part in the care of Mr. Gerdes Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

You recall that he is a 71-year-old gentleman who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment in 03/04/2011 to multiple brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. He initially  presented with sudden onset of diplopia on 02/08/2011 and saw an ophthalmologist who treated his glaucoma, but ordered a CT scan of the head and neck, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was subsequently evaluated in my clinic and an MRI was performed of the orbits, face and neck, which showed nodular soft tissue mass. There was also intraparenchymal brain metastasis involving the left frontal, right temporal, and left parietal lobes. He was recommend to undergo CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment to these multiple lesions. He returns today for his routine surveillance followup, as well as having completed an MRI scan. Symptomatically, he reports no concerning neurological symptoms.Symptomatically, he reports continued diplopia, and remains unsteady on his feet and poor balance. He reports having fallen recently and has sustained a cut on his left hand between the third and fourth finger with swelling in his attempt to break his fall. He sought advice from a personal physician friend who administered bactrim ointment to the hand and recommended to wait a week and seek formal medical evaluation if his it didn't improve.    Physical Examination: He is well appearing, in no acute distress. Temp 36.5 Pulse 64 Resp 18 BP 180/80. Speech clear, thought process coherent. CN 2-12 intact to detailed testing.   Motor strength 5/5 over upper ad lower extremities. Heel to toe tandem walking moderately ataxic. Rhomberg exam negative. His right hand is swollen and with erythema and laceration noted between the third and fourth digits.     I personally reviewed his MRI taken today and it demonstrates worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 28 enhamcing intraparenchymal lesions.    Mr Cahoon is a 71 year old gentleman approximately 1 year SP Cyberknife Radiosurgery treatment to  multiple brain metastasis from Renal Cell Carcinoma with radiographic evidence of disease progression. I spoke to him about his radiographic findings and given the multiple number of lesions, he is not a candidate for Cyberknife Treatment and will defer treatment with whole brain radiation to Dr. Lizaola Gladney, who is seeing the patient in tandem. Regarding his hand injury, there is some concern for infection and fracture and he was recommended to report to Stanford ED for treatment.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.      Sincerely,      Jocelyn Malott, FNP-C  Nurse Practitioner  Department of Neurosurgery/ Cyberknife Program    Addendum: I personally discussed the natural history of the disease and possible interventions with the patient. The patient has symptoms of diplopia and balance difficulties. His neurological exam is notable for moderate ataxia. I reviewed radiographic films  with the patient and agree with the plan as outlined above. He is one year post Cyberknife treatment to multiple brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma with evidence of worsening metastatic disease. I recommend that he undergo whole brain radiation under the direction of Dr. Hara    Joffe Hatami Jeon, MD  Professor  Department of Neurosurgery  Robert C.

Pt notes much improvement in purpura on bilateral arms. He notes almost complete resolution. He does note some swelling has remained in both hands. He recently noted a new rash on his arms for 1 month. This is itchy and different appearing from previous problems. He notes he was out in the sun with some friends and noted a \"bad sunburn.\" After that, he tried some aloe gel. He has been using a moisturizer with aloe from then til now. It will help with the itching some. He wears a UV shirt with long sleeves if he is going to be in the sun for a significant amount of time but does not have photoprotection on if only 5-10 minutes in the sun.

On 01/28/2011, he had the sudden onset of diplopia and saw an ophthalmologist who treats his glaucoma who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was seen by on 02/03/2011. An MRI on the same day of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes.   DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the beginning of the setup and treatment.   On 02/14/2011, the patient underwent the fabrication of the Aquaplast mask followed by a thin-section CT scan. This was accompanied by a thin-section MRI using T1 weighted sequence and contrast.   All studies were carefully reviewed for completeness and for adequacy for fusion and planning using the CyberKnife system. The findings on these studies were then correlated closely with what was seen on prior diagnostic images. The images from the stereotactic CT and MR scans were then  sent by network, from the scanners, to the CyberKnife Multiplan treatment-planning work station.     On the CyberKnife treatment planning work station the stereotactic CT and MR scans were fused with one another. We then used standard drawing tools to delineate the treatment margins.   The target volume and dimensions are listed below. Adjacent critical anatomy was also delineated. In an iterative fashion a treatment plan was developed for this lesion. Once a satisfactory plan was developed, sign-off was obtained from both Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology.

ID:  69 yr old man with newly discovered nasopharynx/clival/sphenoid mass and intraparenchymal brain lesions confirmed to be metastatic renal carcinoma on biopsy of the clivus.  Further staging work-up recently identified the primary tumor in the right kidney as well as other metastases including a left femoral neck bone metastasis.      This current Cyberknife treatment course was directed at the nasopharyngela /clivus mass and the parenchymal brain metastases.  We will plan a separate external beam radiotherpay course to the left femoral neck.    Clinical treatment Planning:  Initial consultation with our team was completed. Informed consent was obtained for  CyberKnife radiosurgery. In preparation for treatment, CT simulation was ordered.     Simulation: The patient returned on 02/14/2011, for treatment simulation.  At that setting, CT images were acquired for a stereotactic field setting.     Treatment Planning: Based on the images acquired at simulation,  the target volume(s) were delineated. At the outset, I set forth treatment planning guidelines to ensure a quality plan. In addition, I requested a special physics consultation in order to gain recommendations on the optimal use of collimation devices and beam angles. Upon my review of the candidate radiosurgery isodose plans, review of the dose-volume histograms, and review of the special physics consultation recommendations, I approved final treatment plan. During the treatment planning process, a significant amount of extra time and effort were expended in order to create the digital radiographs for image guidance, to process treatment plan,and to ensure  overall patient safety.    Treatment delivery:  The patient then returned for treatment delivery. Prior to treatment delivery, on each of the days of treatment, simple simulation images were acquired to ensure that the field alignment was achieved. Once this was completed, the treatment then began.     The treatment was delivered without incident. The patient was given a small dose of dexamethasone at the treatment.     Follow-up:  Clinical follow-up and imaging of the brain and nasopharynx in 6-8 weeks. In the meantime, he will complete the course of external beam therapy to the left femur.    Technical summary:   Name:   Chien Norris  Record #:  72410739  Course #:  1  Residents:  JM   Treatment machine: Cyberknife #1    Fields:   2750cGy in  5 fraction(s) with dose prescribed to the 80 % isodose curve covering the periphery of nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis of volume 30.730 cubic cm.    2400cGy in  1 fraction(s) with dose prescribed to the 79 % isodose curve covering the periphery of left frontal metastasis of volume 0.307cubic cm.    2400cGy in  1 fraction(s) with dose prescribed to the 84 % isodose curve covering the periphery of left parital metastasis of volume 0.307cubic cm.    2400cGy in  1 fraction(s) with dose prescribed to the 85 % isodose curve covering the periphery of right temporal of volume 0.079 cubic cm.

You suggested we go off the Sutent for 3 days. He has not taken the Sutent since Thursday, 09/30/2025, yet this has not made much of a difference with the diarrhea. On Saturday, he only had diarrhea three times, ( I was hopeful) but yesterday, Sunday, it was back (he went about 8 times). The problem is he eating very little and the food is going right through his body. ( It is literally 'food in and food out'). I\u00bfm afraid that he is getting dehydrated. He has no stamina or energy and is very weak and lethargic. He feels awful (he has been taking the Sutent for 18 months). This is the first time he has felt like this!!      I fear that he is no longer tolerating the Sutent (It had been tolerable). Is it an issue that the medicine is accumulating and affecting his body more? His digestive system? Is this to be expected?   His skin blotches (arm, forearm and shoulders) are worse now than it has ever been. The blood tests done in Visalia but sent to Dr. Broussard office show that his Potassium levels are going down ( the low potassium diet seems to be working) \u00bf although food in general is not appealing to Isai and he eats very little.

As you recall, Mr. Ehlers is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post CyberKnife radiosurgery on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2011 to 4 metastatic brain lesions in the following regions: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus, left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastases was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025 through 8, 2011. Followup imaging 04/23/2011, demonstrated stability of all treated lesions with no new metastases. He is maintained on Sutent, and interval extracranial imaging has not been performed. Today he returns for a 4-month follow-up visit, as well as discussion of the results of his most recent MRI.      Symptomatically, Mr. Ehlers Hirai near full resolution of diplopia within 2 months of radiosurgical treatment. However, within the last month and a half, he has noted 2-3 separate episodes of diplopia, which occurred after bending over, and resolved within 1 hour. Additionally, he developed decreased hearing loss bilaterally 6 weeks ago. The hearing loss improved shortly after receiving antibiotics for a sinus infection, though again recurred. The hearing on the right is currently worse than the left after the use of over-the-counter ear wax removal medication in the right ear within the last 2 days. He denies additional neurologic complaints. He has no complaints of headaches, seizures, speech or memory difficulties. The remainder of the 14-point review of systems is negative.     Physical Examination: He is 85 kg, blood pressure 143/84, pulse 79,  temperature 36.5. He is a well-appearing man in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, sclera anicteric.  Left ear is clear with intact tympanic membrane. Right ear with cerumen covering part of his tympanic membrane.  Speech is clear.  Thought process coherent. Mentation: He is alert and oriented x3. Cranial nerves 2-12 are intact to detailed testing. Gait is narrow based and steady. Strength is 5/5 upper and lower extremities. Sensation is intact and symmetric in both upper and lower extremities. Romberg is negative.     I personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier today which was compared to prior imaging at the time of treatment dated 02/13/2011. This shows the treated tumor within the nasopharynx/sphenoid sinus has improved, with interval decrease by approximately 50%. The previous enhancing portion within the sphenoid sinus is now dissipating. The posterior nasopharynx and mucosa remain stable. The treated intraparenchymal metastases within the left frontal lobe (series 14 image 19) left parietal lobe (series 14 image 15), and right temporal lobe (series 14 image 9) have significantly decreased in size with only a small focal area of enhancement remaining. No new metastases are visualized.     Emery Ehlers is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He remains radiographically stable 4 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastases and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are visualized and I am pleased with his progress to date as he continues to remain radiographically and clinically stable. His diplopia is most likely related to ongoing irritation of the nerves by residual tumor as current imaging studies showed no evidence of recurrence. I recommend a repeat stereotactic MRI of the skull base and orbit and clinic visit in 3 months. In the  interim, he will obtain an audiogram for evaluation of the bilateral hearing loss. The audiogram will be coordinated with his next Stanford Medical Oncology appointment scheduled on 07/31/2025. He is also encouraged to contact us sooner should he develop problems before that time.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of Emery Ehlers. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

As you will recall, Mr. Jimenez is a 70-year-old gentleman status post CyberKnife radiosurgery on 02/13/2011, in treatment for metastasis to the cavernous sinus and left parietotemporal metastasis from renal cell cancer. He also left femoral neck metastasis treated with conventional radiotherapy from 02/19/2025 through 02/25/2011. We last saw him on 10/21/2011, at which time his MRI demonstrated stability of all of his previously treated lesions. The anterior brain lesion was stable and his posterior brain lesion was no longer visible. His clivus and nasopharyngeal lesions treated by CyberKnife were also stable to decreased in size and there were no new tumors noted. He reported at that time intermittent diplopia which had been stable. He also had decreased hearing on an audiogram performed in 08/04/2011 that demonstrated poor hearing bilaterally, but worse on the right. Word recognition score was 100% at 95 decibels and speech reception threshold 65 decibels on the right. Word recognition score 100% at 90 decibels on the left and speech recognition threshold at 45 decibels on the left. Following evaluation by ENT, he was found to have bilateral effusions that were causing conductive hearing loss and since that time, he has been wearing bilateral hearing aids. However, he is having difficulty with aberrant screeching from the hearing aids.    Symptomatically today he reports the above-mentioned symptoms continue and remain stable. He has noticed for the last 3 weeks occasional episodes of being unsteady and stumbling over his toes, but he denies any falls. Otherwise, he reports no new neurologic symptoms. He denies any  seizures, headache, speech, or memory difficulties.     On physical examination, he is well appearing and in no acute distress. His temperature is 36.1, pulse 63, respirations 16. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall 180 pounds. His blood pressure is 156/96. He is alert and oriented. Speech is clear. Thought process coherent. Neurologic exam is nonfocal with the exception of bilateral decreased hearing. He is unable to hear finger rub and unable to discern whispered words bilaterally. Otherwise, his neurologic exam is nonfocal.     I personally reviewed his MRI scan obtained here at Stanford on 12/30/2011, that demonstrates stability of the previously treated lesions. There is some slight thickening and enhancement along the dura of Meckel's cave. There are no new lesions identified.     Mr. Jimenez is a 70-year-old man with a history of metastasis to clivus and brain parenchyma from renal cell carcinoma status post CyberKnife radiosurgery in 02/04/2011. He also has a history of left femoral neck metastasis that was treated with conventional radiotherapy on 02/19/2025 through 02/25/2011. It is difficult to determine if the enhancement and thickening in the clivus area extending into the right Meckel's cave is related to treatment effect or diffuse progression. Therefore, I recommend a PET scan that we were able to get scheduled for 01/14/2025. He will be seeing Dr. Byer and Dr. Hennig Ando a couple of weeks and I am happy to see him at that time to review all of his imaging. Otherwise, I recommend he return to clinic in 3 months' time for a new MRI scan and provided the PET CT does not demonstrate any metabolic activity in the area of question. Mr. Jimenez is in agreement with the plan.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of Maung Jimenez. Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions or concerns regarding the care of him or any other patient requiring neurosurgical  intervention.

He is a 71-year-old gentleman who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment in 03/04/2011  to multiple brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. During his last clinic visit with us on 03/08/2013, a surveillance MRI scan demonstrated worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 20 enhancing intraparenchymal lesions in his brain. Due to the numerous lesions noted on his MRI scan, he was recommended to undergo whole brain radiation treatment which he recently completed locally in Visalia. California. Two weeks ago after completion of his radiation treatment, he acutely developed left upper extremity weakness. He was evaluated by his local radiation oncologist who ordered a CT scan of the head for which he brings a copy of the images today. A call was also made to Dr. Eager  Andersson, MD in Radiation Oncology who recommended that the patient present today for an evaluation as well as undergo a new MRI scan. Symptomatically he reports weakness in the left upper extremity but has intact sensation. His wife reports increased fluid retention in his lower extremities, and severe weakness on both legs. He otherwise denies any other neurological symptoms. He denies any headaches, speech difficulties, changes in his cognition, vision changes. He has stable hearing loss on the left ear. She reports that his gait is slower and balance unsteady at times.   He denies any other new concerning neurological symptoms. He is currently taking Decadron 4 mg bid.    Physical Examination: He is well appearing, in no acute distress. His weight is 198 pounds. His height is 5 feet 9 inches. Blood pressure 181/90, pulse 81, temperature 36.7 degrees centigrade. Speech is clear. Thought process coherent. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. There is slight movement of the fingers of the left hand.  He has decreased strength of the left handgrip and can only lift the left arm slightly. His motor strength is also diminished on his left lower extremity, 3/5. His right lower extremity is 4/5 strength and left lower  extremity 5/5 strength. His gait is wide based and steady. Heel to toe balance exam deferred. He has swelling on the right hand from a previous hand injury. He has 4+ pitting edema of the lower extremities.     Dr. Buendia reviewed his MRI scan taken today which is notable for edema surrounding the right motor cortex. There are no new lesions noted.     Mr. Topete Schimmel is a 71-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma, status post CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment in 03/04/2011 for multiple brain metastasis and recently completed whole-brain radiation locally to additional brain metastasis completed a week ago with acute onset of left upper extremity plegia. It is likely that his LUE plegia is related to the surrounding edema to the right motor cortex; however, there is also a possibility that he may have pathology in the C spine that might explain his symptom. We therefore recommend that he undergo a C spine MRI today. He was sent to the ED for an evaluation and treatment of his hand injury that remains unhealed. Given that he has an MRI compatible Pacemaker, we have notified cardiology service for interrogation and reprogramming of his pacer post MRI.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.      Sincerely,        Jocelyn Malott, FNP-C  Nurse Practitioner  Department of Neurosurgery/ Cyberknife/ Neurogenetics           Addendum: I personally discussed the natural history of the disease and possible interventions with the patient. The patient has symptoms of LUE plegia and RLE weakness. I reviewed radiographic films  with the patient and agree with the plan as outlined above. He is SP CK and Whole Brain radiation for numerous multiple brain metastasis from Renal Cell Cancer and recommend that he undergo a C  spine MRI to further assess the cause of his symptoms.

He underwent treatment for his clivus metastasis as well as a total of 3 intraparenchymal brain metastasis. This treatment was performed in 5 sessions from 02/17/2011, through 02/21/2011.     Tumor #1 was his clivus metastasis. This was treated with 27.5 Gy delivered to the 80% isodose line using a 15 and 20 mm collimator over 5 sessions. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 34.38 Gy. The volume treated was 30. 73 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 38 x 49 x 38 mm.

He is a 69-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastases to the skull base and brain 4 months ago. Specifically, a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastases was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025-8, 2011. Followup imaging 04/23/2011, showed stability of all treated lesions and no new metastases.     A repeat MRI of the skull base was obtained earlier today and per report showed interval increase in volume of abnormal marrow signal and enhancement in the skull base reflective of disease progression or treatment-related change, interval slight decrease in size of treated left frontal and parietal lobe metastases, and no new brain parenchymal lesions. The treated right temporal lobe metastases was no longer visualized. Additionally, bilateral mastoid effusions were identified, likely congestive in nature. The right nasopharyngeal mass appeared stable.     Symptomatically, Mr. Iyer Ahn near full resolution of diplopia 2 months after radiosurgical treatment. However, within the last month and a half, he has noted 2-3 separate episodes of diplopia, which occurred after bending over, and resolved within 1 hour. Additionally, he developed bilateral hearing loss 6 weeks ago. The hearing loss improved shortly after receiving antibiotics for a sinus infection, though recurred shortly after the antibiotics were completed. The hearing on the right is currently worse than the left after  the use of over-the-counter ear wax removal solution 2 days ago. Occasional headaches are well managed with with Tylenol Sinus. He denies additional neurologic complaints.    He is maintained on Sutent. Interval extracranial imaging has not been performed.     Allergies: No known drug allergies.     Medications: Cosopt ophthalmic, Norvasc, Coreg, Pepcid, Xalatan ophthalmic drops, Synthroid, Zestril, Protonix, Sutent, Zometa.     Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man in no apparent distress. Height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 85 kg. Temperature 36.5, respirations 18, pulse 79, blood pressure 143/84. KPS 80. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Extraocular movements intact with diplopia on far left lateral gaze. Left canal and tympanic membrane clear. Right canal with cerumen, with the visualized portion of the right tympanic membrane clear. Oropharynx clear. Neck supple. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart with regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Extremities without edema. Skin: Warm, dry, and intact. Neurologic examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact to detailed testing. Motor strength 5/5 within the upper and lower extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Gait steady. Romberg negative.     Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier today which was compared to prior imaging at the time of treatment dated 02/13/2011. This shows the treated tumor within the nasopharynx/sphenoid sinus has improved, with interval decrease in size by approximately 50%. The enhancement within the sphenoid sinus is now dissipating. The posterior nasopharynx and mucosa are stable. The treated intraparenchymal metastases within the left frontal lobe (series 14 image 19) left parietal lobe (series 14 image 15), and right temporal lobe (series 14 image 9) have significantly decreased in size with only a small focal area of  enhancement remaining. No new metastases are visualized.     Summary: Rupert Iyer is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who remains radiographically stable 4 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are visualized. Within the last 1-1/2 months, he has noted occasional episodes of self-limiting diplopia likely related to ongoing irritation by residual tumor, as current imaging studies showed no evidence of recurrence. We are pleased with Mr. Springer response to treatment and recommend a repeat MRI of the skull base in 3 months. In the interim, he will obtain an audiogram for evaluation of the bilateral hearing loss. The audiogram will be coordinated with his next Stanford Medical Oncology appointment scheduled on 07/31/2025.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Rupert Iyer.

I would like to check on the progress of all the lesions over the next 6 weeks to ensure that these are resolving. The typical senile purpura will like persist and are likely  exaccerbated due to the mildly decreased platelet count and chemotherapy effect.

While you know his history well, please allow me to review it for our records.    This patient is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denies weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. He saw his ophthalmologist who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Gillespie Bean 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI  of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid  soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature. He presents today for treatment recommendations.    Mr. Fraga relates that aside from diplopia, he is feeling well. He uses an eye patch. Denies any pain. He is eating and drinking well and his weight is stable. No difficulty ambulating- he notices \"something\" in the left thigh, although denies pain there. No weakness in extremities bilaterally. He denies shortness of breath, fever, chills, night sweats, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, dysuria, or change in bowel habits.

Additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of   Rosenm?ller extending inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the   oropharynx. Signal characteristics of this lesion suggests that it   is unrelated to the aggressive lesion previously described. Finding   may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other   proteinaceous fluid collection.    3. Multiple intracranial enhancing lesions are worrisome for   metastatic disease.    Impression / Plan     This patient is a 69 Y male who presented with diplopia and was diagnosed with likely renal cell cancer after a biopsy of a clival mass was performed on 02/04/2011. He is likely intermediate risk given his good performance status, he is not anemic on recent labs, and his calcium is within normal range. Further staging with a  PET scan and CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right  paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature. He is scheduled to begin cyberknife on 02/17/2011 for five days to the nasopharynx and brain. Also discussed radiating his left femur metastases with Dr. High who agrees. Discussed systemic therapy today with the patient and his wife. The side effects and schedule of sutent 50mg po daily were discussed and the patient received a handout. All of their questions were answered. He was provided with a prescription and is to start sutent following radiation thearpy next week to minimize side effects, particularly mucositis.     Discussed the potential for pathologic fracture of the left femur. He was encouraged to use a cane to minimize weight bearing on the left side. Will also discuss initiating zometa at his next appointment.    The patient and his wife agree to and understand the above plan. They know to call in the interim with questions or concerns. Mr. Fraga Siri return to our clinic in 4 weeks for labs and physical exam or prior to that time if necessary.    Thank you for referring this very pleasant patient to our clinic. Please do not hesitate to contact Dr. Ghai with questions or concerns.

He is a 70-year-old man  treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery 1 year ago for metastases of renal cell carcinoma involving the skull base, nasopharynx, clivus and cavernous sinus region ans well as intraparenchymal brain metastases. I briefly saw Mr. Faust Eggers clinic several weeks ago 01/16/2012 (during Dr. Iles appointment).  At that time the recent MRI suggested possible worsening of tumor at the skull base with extension to the right.He was due for a PET scan, which he has since had, on 01/14/2012. We added the brain for that PET scan.    Summary of previous radiation:  Cyberknife to skull bae. Nasopharynx/clivus as well as a frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis and right temporal metastasis treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2011, and 02/18/2025 to 02/21/2011. He received external beam radiation to 20 Gy to his left femoral neck metastasis from 02/19/2025 to 02/25/2011.     Symptomatically, he is doing well. He has had no new pains or headaches.  The PET scan revealed that the area in the clivus region was hypometabolic, not concerning for tumor. He is here to discuss the PET results.    On examination, blood pressure 130/64, pulse 48, temperature 98, respirations 18. KPS 90%. He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination 2 through 12 intact to detailed testing. He has hearing aids bilaterally. Full strength in the upper and lower extremities with normal tone and bulk. Sensory examination intact to light touch. Reflexes symmetric Gait examination narrow based and steady.     We personally reviewed his PET scan taken on 01/14/2012, revealing stable disease. We reviewed the PET scan with him in great detail, as well as the MRI scan of the  skull base taken on 12/30/2011, and referencing the PET scan.    Mr. Faust is a 70-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the clivus, as well as left parietal, left frontal and right temporal lobe. Although the recent MRI suggested possible interval change, the recent PET scan fails to show worsened metabolic activity in the region of the skull base. As there is some FDG-avidity, we cannot rule out persistent disease. However, we do not believe that additional radiation treatment to this region is warranted at this time.  He will return in 3 months for another MRI scan of the skull base using fat-suppresion and contrast.    Thank you for allowing me to participate in Manjinder Faust's care.

As you will recall, Mr. Greathouse is a 70-year-old gentleman status post CyberKnife radiosurgery on 02/13/2011, in treatment for metastasis to the cavernous sinus and left parietotemporal metastasis from renal cell cancer. He also left femoral neck metastasis treated with conventional radiotherapy from 02/19/2025 through 02/25/2011. We last saw him on 10/21/2011, at which time his MRI demonstrated stability of all of his previously treated lesions. The anterior brain lesion was stable and his posterior brain lesion was no longer visible. His clivus and nasopharyngeal lesions treated by CyberKnife were also stable to decreased in size and there were no new tumors noted. He reported at that time  intermittent diplopia which had been stable. He also had decreased hearing on an audiogram performed in 08/04/2011 that demonstrated poor hearing bilaterally, but worse on the right. Word recognition score was 100% at 95 decibels and speech reception threshold 65 decibels on the right. Word recognition score 100% at 90 decibels on the left and speech recognition threshold at 45 decibels on the left. Following evaluation by ENT, he was found to have bilateral effusions that were causing conductive hearing loss and since that time, he has been wearing bilateral hearing aids. However, he is having difficulty with aberrant screeching from the hearing aids.    Symptomatically today he reports the above-mentioned symptoms continue and remain stable. He has noticed for the last 3 weeks occasional episodes of being unsteady and stumbling over his toes, but he denies any falls.   Otherwise, he reports no new neurologic symptoms. He denies any seizures, headache, speech, or memory difficulties.     On physical examination, he is well appearing and in no acute distress. His temperature is 36.1, pulse 63, respirations 16. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall 180 pounds. His blood pressure is 156/96. He is alert and oriented. Speech is clear. Thought process coherent. Neurologic exam is nonfocal with the exception of bilateral decreased hearing. He is unable to hear finger rub and unable to discern whispered words bilaterally. Otherwise, his neurologic exam is nonfocal.     I personally reviewed his MRI scan obtained here at Stanford on 12/30/2011, that demonstrates stability of the previously treated lesions. There is some slight thickening and enhancement along the dura of Meckel's cave. There are no new lesions identified.     Mr. Greathouse is a 70-year-old man with a history of metastasis to clivus and brain parenchyma from renal cell carcinoma status post CyberKnife radiosurgery in 02/04/2011. He also has a history of left  femoral neck metastasis that was treated with conventional radiotherapy on 02/19/2025 through 02/25/2011. It is difficult to determine if the enhancement and thickening in the clivus area extending into the right Meckel's cave is related to treatment effect or diffuse progression. Therefore, I recommend a PET scan that we were able to get scheduled for 01/14/2025. He will be seeing Dr. Olive and Dr. Abrego Espinal a couple of weeks and I am happy to see him at that time to review all of his imaging. Otherwise, I recommend he return to clinic in 3 months' time for a new MRI scan and provided the PET CT does not demonstrate any metabolic activity in the area of question. Mr. Greathouse is in agreement with the plan.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of Sudhanshu Greathouse. Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions or concerns regarding the care of him or any other patient requiring neurosurgical intervention.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up today.    Oncology History: This is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Edmondson Pope 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue  mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Lui Swanson/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily.       Review of Systems: Overall tolerating sutent with side effects of mucositis, diarrhea, and some mild fatigue. He relates that symptoms improve during the rest weeks. He has noticed BLE edema over the last month. No sob or chest pain. Edema decreases slightly with elevation. He has occasional diplopia, particularly after gazing laterally to the left. Has also noticed some balance changes, although no falls. Feels that his hearing is worse. After ENT consult at Stanford in early 10/04/2011 hearing aides were recommended; he is now wearing hearing aides bilaterally. He has liquid nasal discharge in the mornings, which resolves quickly. No recent fever, chills, sinus tenderness, headaches. Some moderate fatigue, but he is playing golf occasionally. He has noticed easy cuts/bruising on his forearms.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the femur in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Riddell for exam and MRI.    Plan:  - Hold zometa today d/t hypocalcemia  - BLE edema: changed echo appointment from 01/14/2012 to 12/30/2011 to evaluate as his BNP is elevated today. No chest pain or SOB. He will follow up with Dr. Dorr Gainer late January  - Diplopia, hearing changes, and change in balance: will have brain MRI on 12/30/2011 and f/u with Dr. Gilles  Echevarria Continue sutent 50mg po daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off  - Continue synthroid for likely sutent-induced hypothyroidism. TSH pending today.    He will return in 6 weeks for Avitia, MD, zometa. We did discuss the possibility of nephrectomy with the urologic oncology surgeons as he has responded well to sutent; however there are concerns regarding the brain and bone lesiopns which may not make him a great candidate for cytoreductive nephrectomy.     The patient and his wife agree to and understand the above plan. They know to call in the interim with questions or concerns.    This patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Fargo Renderos    Sigal Royal, NP 12/24/2011     I have reviewed the history of present illness, personally confirmed the interval history, social history, complete 14 pt ROS, physical examination, laboratory and radiology studies and agree with the documentation in the note above.

He is a 69-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastases to the skull base and brain 8 months ago. Specifically, a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastasis was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025-8th, 2011. He was last seen in followup in this department on 07/04/2011 at which time he was radiographically stable.    A repeat MRI of the skull base was performed earlier today. The formal radiology report is pending. Additionally, a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed today, and he is planning to discuss the results with Dr. Bejarano Behm the medical oncology department tomorrow. He continues Sutent, which he is tolerating well.    Symptomatically, Mr. Barrios continues to report occasional episodes of diplopia noted when looking to the far left. He has known bilateral middle ear/mastoid effusions and underwent a recent audiogram, showing bilateral mixed hearing loss, primarily conductive. It was recommended that he treat the hearing loss conservatively with hearing aids before considering PE tube placement. He also reports cold intolerance, currently is maintained on Synthroid 50 mcg daily and underwent a repeat TSH today, with an elevated result of 6.14. He further reports that his skin is thin and tears easily the past 4 months. He denies additional complaints. The pain within the left hip and leg has completely resolved.    Allergies: NKDA.    Medications: Coreg,  nystatin oral suspension, Pepcid, Synthroid, lisinopril, Zometa, Protonix, Sutent, Cosopt ophthalmic drops, Xalatan Ophthalmic Drops, Norvasc.    Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man in no acute distress. KPS 80. Temperature 36.9, pulse 53, blood pressure 153/83. Weight 83.6 kg. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx clear. He is wearing hearing aids bilaterally. Neck supple. Breathing unlabored. Skin warm and dry, with bruising to the right hand and forearm. Neurologic Examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact to detailed testing. Motor strength 5/5 within the upper and lower extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Gait steady. Tandem walk intact.    Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier today, which was compared to prior imaging from 07/04/2011 and 02/14/2011. The treated left frontal metastasis is barely seen on the current examination (series 12, image 25). The treated right temporal and left parietal metastases are no longer seen. The nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous metastasis remains stable. Mastoid disease has increased since February, and is slightly worse when compared to imaging performed in July. No new intracranial metastatic disease is identified. Review of today's CT scan shows the left femoral neck metastasis has interval subtle improvement.    Summary: Cyril Barrios is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal carcinoma who remains radiographically stable 8 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are identified. Symptomatically, he continues to report occasional episodes of diplopia when looking to the far left, though has no new neurologic complaints. We have asked that he return to this clinic with  a repeat MRI in 3 months. In the interim, he will follow up with the medical oncology department tomorrow to discuss the results of today's CT scan. Additionally he states that his Synthroid is managed by the medical oncology department, and will discuss the elevated TSH result with him tomorrow.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Cyril Barrios. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain;  chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Hinshaw for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Drs. Chang saw him 04/27/2012 and is happy with his continued response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior nasopharynx that has remained stable for some time, and encompasses the eustachian tube. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time.He will see him in 9/12 with another MRI of brain.     PLAN:   - Hold Zometa today as creatinine is 2.0.  Will order Denosumab for next visit.  - TSH: 10.9  Will increase levothyroxine to 125 mcg daily, e-prescription sent to local CVS Pharmacy  - Continue sutent 2 weeks on/1 week off.

As you know, he is a pleasant 70-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction. He has been on sunitinib therapy since 03/04/2011, and has blood pressure recently while controlled on combination of 4 antihypertensives. His ejection fraction was noted in 01/04/2012, to be approximately 47%.   He has continued on sunitinib since 02/22/2011, with recent change in his dosing from 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off to 2 weeks on and 1 week off in an attempt to reduce his non-cardiovascular side-effects.     He symptomatically notes he is able to walk 9 of his 18 holes of golf and plays approximately 3 rounds per week with no significant complaints.     He notes that on home blood pressure monitoring, his blood pressure machine has been noting pulses as low as the mid 30s, with some variability in his blood pressure recording on repeated testing. EKG was performed today in clinic, which shows supraventricular bigeminy and a ventricular response rate of 64 beats per minute. He also has first degree AV block and right bundle branch block with left anterior fascicular block with a PR interval of 326 and QRS duration of 154. He specifically denies any symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness or frank syncope and again notes no change in his exertional tolerance.     A complete 14-point review of systems was notable for complains of pinkish fluid that is draining from his nasopharynx. He notes some cold intolerance and easy bruising and bleeding when he cuts himself is difficult to control.     Allergies: He has no known drug allergies.     Current Medication: He is on Norvasc 10 mg once daily. He is taking carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, Pepcid 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide  12.5 mg daily, Synthroid 100 mcg daily, timolol eye drops, lisinopril 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg daily, sunitinib 50 mg, 2 weeks on 1 week off and Zometa IV. He states that he has recently increased his Synthroid from 75 to 100 mcg daily on the advise of Dr. Brun     Fanning physical exam today, blood pressure 118/76, repeat 152/87, repeat by manual cuff averaging 126/84 with significant variability depending on his palpated pulse. His average pulse is 63, respirations 16, weight 84 kg, and height 5 feet 9 inches. Oxygen saturation 97% on room air. General: He is a well-appearing man in no acute distress. Appears his stated age. Oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes. Jugular venous pressure is not particularly elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is intermittently irregular with no significant murmurs, rubs, or gallops. PMI is not laterally displaced. Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended. Extremities are warm and well perfused with 2+ pulses bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities and no peripheral edema.   Neurologically and psychiatrically appears appropriate and intact.   He underwent echocardiogram today, 04/07/2012, which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular size and mild to moderately reduced systolic function with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. There is left atrial enlargement, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation with estimated RVSP of 32 mmHg. Compared to 12/30/2024, there is no significant change in his echocardiogram.     In recent laboratory testing, his sodium 139, potassium 3.8, creatinine of 1.2, and BUN of 25. His TSH 13.2 in 03/17/2025, up from 6.38 in 02/04/2012. His last BNP 1126, which is stable for him.     In summary, Mr. Ponder is a 70-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with controlled hypertension and mild left  ventricular systolic dysfunction. His home blood pressure recording findings are explained by his frequent premature atrial contractions on EKG today, as his peripheral pulse is diminished with a short coupling interval between his sinus and atrial beats.   As he is asymptomatic and given his overall clinical picture, we would favor a trial of decreasing his carvedilol to 6.25 mg twice daily and continued observation, especially in light of his trifascicular block on ECG.     We counseled him that were he to develop symptoms of lightheadedness or presyncope, that further investigation for more significant bradyarrhythmia could be undertaken. We note that given his renal cell carcinoma, antiplatelets and anticoagulation for primary prevention purposes are likely to lead to more bleeding risk and questionable benefit in Mr. Ponder and thus we would favor avoiding these agents. We anticipate seeing him again in approximately 6 months with EKG and echocardiogram prior. We have asked him to discuss his recurrent nasal discharge with our colleagues in otolaryngology, who may have more definitive diagnostic and treatment modalities at their disposal.     We appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in his care.                       Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.

He has had mildly to mild moderately reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography and a recent hospitalization for bradycardia. He reports to us that in July he noted on consecutive days low pulse rate on his home blood pressure monitor, down to a rate of 35. He also had for the 1st time developed some lightheadedness on 06/23/2025. He called our colleagues at the Cancer Center, who recommended that he proceed to the local emergency room, which he did. There he was admitted and evaluated by his local electrophysiologist. It was decided to go forward with a dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which was and was successful with some difficulties with hematoma in the postoperative period. He did not require reexploration and had no signs of infection. He was implanted with a Medtronics SureScan MRI compatible dual-chamber pacemaker. This will greatly facilitate future examinations to evaluate progression of his metastatic disease.     He again notes that he is having daily symptoms of serosanguineous drainage from his nose after awakening. He also complains of some exertional intolerance that has improved mildly since his pacemaker placement, but he is still on a gradual but slow decline in terms of over the past year. He states he has not played golf, which was his usual form of intentional exercise since his pacemaker placement, which is now greater than 6 weeks ago. He is planning on playing his 1st round of golf with his pacemaker this Sunday.      A complete 14-point review of systems was also notable for swelling in the bilateral ankles, as well as a severe sunburn on the bilateral forearms. He also notes new swelling over the past week of his left arm greater than right. This is the site of his new pacemaker generator.     Current Medications: Amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol is currently held, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg daily that he believes has recently increased, and 40 mg daily of lisinopril. He is also taking Protonix and sunitinib as directed.     Physical Exam: Today, blood pressure 144/73, pulse 67, respirations 16, weight 79 kg. Height 5 feet 9 inches, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. In general, he is an elderly appearing man in no acute distress. Appears stated age. Oropharynx clear with moist mucous membranes. Jugular venous pressure not appreciably elevated. Thyroid is not palpably enlarged. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. There is a well-healed pacemaker pocket scar with 1 stitch and some granular material beneath it without tenderness or fluctuance. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatojugular reflux. There are positive bowel sounds. Extremities are warm, well perfused, with 2+ edema to the knee bilaterally in the lower extremities and nonpitting edema of the left forearm. There is erythema and scaling on the bilateral forearms. He has no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically and psychiatrically he appears appropriate and intact with normal gait and range of motion of the left arm.     Recent Laboratory Testing: 07/28/2012, shows sodium of 139, potassium 4.6, BUN of 38 and a creatinine of 2.3, that is up from 2.0 in June, and 1.8 May this year. His albumin was also low at 2.5 and TSH elevated at 9.7.     The echocardiogram performed today showed a ventricular pacemaker activation with mild left  ventricular enlargement and moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 41% with significant conduction and apical wall motion abnormalities, reflecting his pacemaker activation. Compared to the echocardiogram in 04/04/2012, his overall left ventricular function appears mildly decreased. The right ventricular systolic pressure is 38 mmHg, and estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg.     In summary, Mr. Bowers is a 70-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, on sunitinib therapy, who has had hypertension as well as left ventricular dysfunction. He does have some symptoms suggestive with exertional intolerance that could be related to heart failure. We would favor continuation of his Sinemet as prescribed by Dr. Barry and re-initiation of carvedilol at 3.125 mg twice daily for 1 week and then up titrated to 6.25 mg twice daily. Additionally given his evidence Of edema, we would he increase his hydrochlorothiazide to a full 25 mg each day. He is to continue his other medications for afterload reduction and control of his hypertension. We would not at this time favor addition of Aldactone, given his recent potassium of 4.6.     We asked him to get routine laboratory studies in about 1 week.   He is to have followup with us if his home blood pressures remain above 140 systolic so we can further up titrate his medications. We are hopeful that with some modest diuresis and re-initiation of carvedilol, that he will have some improvement in his symptoms over time and will continue to tolerate his sunitinib chemotherapy. We note that given the MRI compatible device, he should be able to have followup screening MRIs, however, we remain available to his radiology team if questions or concerns should arise regarding this.         We appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in his care. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.

Hwang and Srinivas,     We had the pleasure of seeing mutual patient, Rory Ahn, in followup in the radiosurgery clinic today.     He is a 69-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastases to the skull base and brain 4 months ago. Specifically, a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastases was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025-8, 2011. Followup imaging 04/23/2011, showed stability of all treated lesions and no new metastases.     A repeat MRI of the skull base was obtained earlier today and per report showed interval increase in volume of abnormal marrow signal and enhancement in the skull base reflective of disease progression or treatment-related change, interval slight decrease in size of treated left frontal and parietal lobe metastases, and no new brain parenchymal lesions. The treated right temporal lobe metastases was no longer visualized. Additionally, bilateral mastoid effusions were identified, likely congestive in nature. The right  nasopharyngeal mass appeared stable.           Symptomatically, Mr. Ahn Alameda near full resolution of diplopia 2 months after radiosurgical treatment. However, within the last month and a half, he has noted 2-3 separate episodes of diplopia, which occurred after bending over, and resolved within 1 hour. Additionally, he developed bilateral hearing loss 6 weeks ago. The hearing loss improved shortly after receiving antibiotics for a sinus infection, though recurred shortly after the antibiotics were completed. The hearing on the right is currently worse than the left after the use of over-the-counter ear wax removal solution 2 days ago. Occasional headaches are well managed with with Tylenol Sinus. He denies additional neurologic complaints.     He is maintained on Sutent. Interval extracranial imaging has not been performed.     Allergies: No known drug allergies.     Medications: Cosopt ophthalmic, Norvasc, Coreg, Pepcid, Xalatan ophthalmic drops, Synthroid, Zestril, Protonix, Sutent, Zometa.   Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man in no apparent distress. Height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 85 kg. Temperature 36.5, respirations 18, pulse 79, blood pressure 143/84. KPS 80. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Extraocular movements intact with diplopia on far left lateral gaze. Left canal and tympanic membrane clear. Right canal with cerumen, with the visualized portion of the right tympanic membrane clear. Oropharynx clear. Neck supple. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart with regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Extremities without edema. Skin: Warm, dry, and intact. Neurologic examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact to detailed testing. Motor strength 5/5 within the upper and lower extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Gait steady. Romberg negative.     Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier  today which was compared to prior imaging at the time of treatment dated 02/13/2011. This shows the treated tumor within the nasopharynx/sphenoid sinus has improved, with interval decrease in size by approximately 50%. The enhancement within the sphenoid sinus is now dissipating. The posterior nasopharynx and mucosa are stable.         The treated intraparenchymal metastases within the left frontal lobe (series 14 image 19) left parietal lobe (series 14 image 15), and right temporal lobe (series 14 image 9) have significantly decreased in size with only a small focal area of enhancement remaining. No new metastases are visualized.     Summary: Rory Ahn is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who remains radiographically stable 4 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are visualized. Within the last 1-1/2 months, he has noted occasional episodes of self-limiting diplopia likely related to ongoing irritation by residual tumor, as current imaging studies showed no evidence of recurrence. We are pleased with Mr. Bevilacqua response to treatment and recommend a repeat MRI of the skull base in 3 months. In the interim, he will obtain an audiogram for evaluation of the bilateral hearing loss. The audiogram will be coordinated with his next Stanford Medical Oncology appointment scheduled on 07/31/2025.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Rory Ahn. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Mr. Pascoe has metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which was first diagnosed in 02/04/2011 with skull and brain metastasis. He received Cyberknife, XRT, and stated on Sutent was well until recently. He hass an eventful last few months; in late August he developed bilateral lower extremity edema and some exercise intolerance, and he was started on lasix for possible heart failure. In mid-October, he developed severe diarrhea and hospitalized for AKI and dehydration, and found to have C difficlie colitis and treated with Flagyl. His C diff recurred and was treated with an additional 3 week of Flagyl, before being transitioned to vancomycin PO. In addition, after his hospitalization and rehydration he noted significant dyspnea on exertion, as well as continued LE edema. He was also found by Dr. Deasy Alejandre have a new large right sided pleural effusion, with mild right-to-left mediastinal shift. He had a therapeutic thoracentesis, removing 3.7 liters of light red pleural fluid on 11/30. In addition, he was found on PET CT in 11/04/2012 to have a new liver lesion, and started on Pazopanib.

Overall Impression    Active Hospital Problem List   Diagnoses Date Noted   \u00bf Hypercalcemia 12/01/2012       Assessment/Plan   Mr. Pascoe is a very pleasant 71 yo gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, HTN, left ventricular dysfunction, recent C difficile infection, several weeks of generalized weakness, found to have hypercalcemia.     # Hypercalcemia    Found on lab draw after Heart Failure  Clinic to be hypercalcemia, calcium of 12.1; corrected to 13.4 for albumin. This is almost certainly secondary to his renal cell carcinoma which is metastatic to bone. He has received zoledronic acid in the past, last in 11/04/2011. It appears he is mildly symptomatic from this, with generalized weakness, and possibly slow mentation (not detected on exam today, but noted in Dr. Habib notes, who knows patient longitutally)   He is volume depleted on exam, likely from hypercalcemia induced natriuresis and resolving C. Diff diarrhea. Will need to be cautious with aggressive hydration given low ejection fraction and large right pleural effusion.  --Given NS 500cc in the ED, and started on NS 200cc/hr. On re-evaluation after 1L total (exam above), appeared appeared closer to euvolemia with stable respiratory status, breathing well on RA. Given additional 500cc bolus and NS 200cc/hr continued.   --Continue NS 200cc/hr, monitor respiratory status closely, can give lasix as needed if developing volume overload  --Will give Zometa, but will hold off until creatinine improves    # AKI  Likely pre-renal in nature, clearly volume depleted on admission.   -Hydration as above, hold diuretics except as needed for volume status above     # Left ventricular dysfunction and HTN  EF 29% on most recent echo. Volume depleted on exam.   -Hold lasix except as needed for respiratory status  -Hold carvedilol 12.5mg for now, continue amoldipine    # History of recurrent C diff  Finished course of PO vancomycin yesterday. Stated diarrhea subsided four days ago, now having soft but formed stools.  -Monitor stools, if diarrhea, would restart PO vancomycin.     # R pleural effusion  Clearly has large R pleural effusion on exam. Suspect malignant effusion over secondary to heart failure given unilateral, pink color, and rapid re-accumulation since thoracentesis 11/30 though cytology negative (no other diagnostic studies done).   -Currently  stable from respiratory standpoint; could consider diagnostic/theraputic thoracentesis or consideration of PleurX catheter in discussion with Oncology.     # Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma  -Oncology consult to write for Pazopanib while in hospital, discuss management of     # Glaucoma  -Continue Cosopt and latanoprost drops.

You will recall that he is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history of renal cell carcinoma that metastasized to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus, and cavernous sinus region. He also had left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal metastases which were all treated from 02/17/2011 through 02/18/2025 through 4th, 2011. He received external-beam radiation in addition to his left femoral neck metastasis on 02/19/2025 to 02/25/2011.     During his last evaluation in February there was concern in his MRI scan of an interval progression of clival disease with extension to the right side of the clivus. He underwent a PET CT of the head completed on 01/14/2012 and demonstrated no evidence of hypermetabolic activity and  therefore not concerning for tumor or disease progression.     Symptomatically, he reports having resolving but still intermittent diplopia approximately 2 weeks ago. He also has stable hearing loss and wears bilateral hearing aids. He complains of some headaches and mild balance difficulties, although he does not require any assistive device on walking. He takes Zometa and Sutent for systemic disease under the direction of Dr. Toney Schulte uro-oncology.     On physical examination, he is well appearing, in no acute distress. His temperature is 36.6 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse is 57, respirations 15, weight 80.5 kg, blood pressure 143/91. Speech is clear, thought process coherent. Cranial nerves 2-12 intact to detailed testing. Extraocular movements full. Gait steady and narrow based. Heel-to-toe tandem walking is intact without evidence of ataxia. Neuro exam is nonfocal.     I personally reviewed his MRI scan today, and it demonstrates that his treated left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal lesions have decreased significantly in size; however, I reviewed the lesion located in the clivus with Dr. Speed, neuroradiology, in consultation and she concurs that the clivus appears stable and unchanged compared to his previous scans approximately 3 months ago.     Mr. Vines Oneil is a 70-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery in 02/04/2011 to clivus, left frontal and left parietal and right temporal regions, who maintains clinical and radiographic stability of his treated lesions. My recommendation is that he return to us in 4 months' time for another skull base and nasopharynx MRI scan as well as a clinical followup. He was instructed to call our clinic should he have any changes in his neurological status in the interim.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.    He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for Zometa today.    Oncology History: This is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Beene Plazola 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft  tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011:  XRT to  left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Toh Hillyard/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT    02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.    02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily. Completes his 2nd, 4 week course on 05/03/2025.    04/23/2011: A skull base MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.    Review of Systems:  Tolerating Sutent well in general. Heartburn is controlled with Protonix. Mouth discomfort and some difficulty with swallowing is managed with Stanford Mouthwash. He has had a rash in axillary area bilaterally, bilateral groins, and buttucks; no open sores or blisters. Nystatin powder has helped his rash. No hand or foot symptoms. Mild fatigue.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 69 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the femur in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 04/23/2025, 2011showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.     Sutent 50 mg daily was begun on 02/22/2011. He completes his 2nd, 4 week course on 05/03/2011. He has tolerated the  Sutent fairly well and has had an excellent CT response.    PLAN:  - Discuss his case at GU Tumor Board for consideration of right laparoscopic nephrectomy / timing of surgery  - Zometa today  - ECHO today (05/01/2011) shows EF of 45%, no prior for comparison, will refer to Dr. Masri  Tachibana Prescriptions refilled at Stanford Walgreen's today  - Restart Sutent on 05/17/2025, 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off  - RTC on 06/19/2025 for f/u and will be evalautaed that date for Zometa  - Call in the interim with any problems or questions.      This patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Raj Pick    Nancy Malouf Kay, NP 05/02/2011     I have reviewed the history of present illness, personally confirmed the interval history, social history, complete 14 pt ROS, physical examination, laboratory and radiology studies and agree with the documentation in the note above.

You will recall that he is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of nasopharyngeal clival sphenoid mass and an intraparenchymal brain lesion from metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery in late February/early 03/04/2011, to 4 lesions located in the clivus region, a left frontal lesion, a left parietal metastatic lesion, and a right temporal metastatic lesion. Today he returns for his 3 month followup as well as discussion of the results of his most recent MRI. Symptomatically, he has no concerning neurological complaints. No complaints of headache. No complaints of seizures or headaches or problems with speech or memory difficulties.     On physical examination, he is well-appearing, in no acute distress. His blood pressure is 131/84, his pulse is 94, his respirations 16. His temperature is 36.4 degrees centigrade. His weight is 90.7 kg. His height is 5 feet 9 inches. His speech is clear, his thought process clear. Mentation alert and oriented. His cranial nerves 2-12 are intact to detailed testing. His gait is narrow-based and steady. His strength is 5/5 of upper and lower extremities. His sensation is intact symmetric bilaterally upper and lower extremities. Motor strength is 5/5 of upper and lower extremities. His Romberg exam is negative. His heel-to-toe and tandem walking is intact.     I personally reviewed his MRI scan today and it demonstrates a smaller size of his lesion located in the clival region as well as his right temporal region. His other 2 lesions are no longer visible on scan and were previously located in the left frontal and left parietal region. No other new  lesions are noted.     Mr. Firestone is a 69-year-old gentleman with 4 metastatic brain lesions from renal cell carcinoma treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery in 03/04/2011 who now maintains radiographic clinical stability of his treated lesions.     My recommendation is he return to our clinic in 3 months' time for another clinical followup as well as a surveillance MRI scan.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in her care. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

And Jeanette Powell Professor of Neurosurgery     Addendum:  I personally discussed the patient's current clincal condition with them.

You will recall, he is a 69-year-old gentleman who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery on 02/13/2011 for treatment of a metastasis to the cavernous sinus, left parietotemporal metastasis, from renal cell cancer. He also had left femoral neck metastasis treated with conventional radiotherapy on 02/19/2025 through the 8th of 2011. Followup imaging on 02/21/2011 demonstrated the above noted treated lesions with no new metastasis. He is maintained on Sutent and presents today for his routine 4-month followup visit, as well as discussion of the results of his most recent MRI scan. Symptomatically, Mr. Simonson Rajaraman intermittent diplopia, which has been stable and is slightly better from his last visit. He also had complaints during his last visit of decreased hearing loss. His audiogram in 08/04/2011 demonstrated poor hearing bilaterally, worse on the right side, with a Word Recognition Score of 100% at 95 decibels on the right and Word Recognition Score of 100% at 90 decibels on the left, and an SRT score of 65 decibels on the right and 45 decibels on the left. He was subsequently evaluated by an ENT surgeon, who on imaging found him to have bilateral effusion that was the cause of his conductive hearing loss. He was recommended to wear bilateral hearing aids, which he is wearing today, and reports that his hearing is a bit better compared to his previous hearing level. He denies any other concerning neurological symptoms. He denies any seizures, headaches, speech or memory difficulties.     On physical examination, he is well appearing, in no acute distress. His temperature is 36.9 degrees Centigrade, his pulse is 53, he weighs 86.3 kg, his blood  pressure is 153/83. Speech clear. Thought process coherent. Neurologic exam nonfocal.     We personally reviewed his MRI scan taken today and it demonstrates stability of all of his previously treated lesions. The anterior brain lesion now measures 2.2 x 0.2 mm and his posterior brain lesion is no longer visible. His clivus and nasopharyngeal lesions treated by CyberKnife also appear stable to decreased in size. There are no new tumors noted.     Mr. Simonson Forsythe is a 69-year-old gentleman with renal cell cancer, with multiple metastases to the brain, treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery from 02/17/2025 through 02/21/2011, who demonstrates clinical and radiographic stability post treatment. My recommendation is that he return to our clinic for another surveillance MRI scan in 4 months' time. He understands to call our clinic should he have any changes in his neurological symptoms in the interim.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

Since starting flagyl and diarrhea improvement, his appetite has returned.   Pt is nl wt for ht per BMI, but he has lost 4% of his body wt in the past 2 months. There was even more significant wt loss was during the time of diarrhea and decreased PO intake, but he gained wt from his low of 156lbs. Anticipate wt loss will stop with current PO intake and diarrhea control.   H/o hyperkalemia, but now resolved. This was likely due to ARF due to dehydration.

He is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus and cavernous sinus region. He also had left frontal, left parietal and right temporal metastasis. These were all treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery from 02/09/2011, to 02/21/2011. His last clinic visit with me was 04/27/2012, at which point all lesions were stable. Since his last clinic visit, the patient overall reports he has been doing reasonably well. He denies any specific seizures or cognitive difficulty. He has had occasional trace headaches but nothing significant.     On examination today, blood pressure 153/89, pulse 69, weight was 77.1 kg, height 1.74 m. Pain was 0 on a scale of 0/10 while in clinic today. Neurologic exam revealed that he was awake and alert and able to follow commands well. Cranial nerves 2-12 were bilaterally intact. Motor exam revealed 5/5 strength in all extremities. Sensory exam was intact to light touch. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric throughout and gait was normal.     Overall, I am pleased with the patient's response to date.     I reviewed the patient's MRI scan obtained earlier today. This shows stability in his intracranial and skull based lesions. Of note, he only was able to obtain a noncontrast MRI scan due to elevated creatinine levels above 2.5.     I discussed these radiographic findings with the patient. I have recommended that we undergo a followup MRI scan of his brain in 6 months. The patient will obtain that study and return my clinic once the study is completed.      Thank for allowing me to participate in care of your patient. Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions regarding my care of Niranjan, or if I can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

As you know, Mr. Gass Downie generally healthy until approximately 11/04/2010, when he first  manifested symptoms of hypertension. Was started on amlodipine and lisinopril therapy. He, unfortunately, developed diplopia, as well as fatigue, weight loss, and a general sense of malaise in February of this year, at which point a CT scan had demonstrated several intraparenchymal masses, as well as 2 cm sphenoid sinus mass. He ultimately underwent a clivus biopsy on 02/04/2025 which had demonstrated findings consistent with possible renal primary and started XRT nasopharynx and brain and underwent 5 subsequent cycles. He also underwent CyberKnife therapy in early March. He began sunitinib therapy on 02/22/2025 and has continued on this to date. He is currently on 4-week on, 2-week off cycle, and is on the second cycle at present. He notes a relatively marked decline in his energy level since starting sunitinib therapy but has not noted any dyspnea on exertion, chest pressure, shortness of breath at rest, orthopnea, PND or palpitations. He, however, is notably less than active than he was prior. He states for example that he completed a 150 mile bike trip in Europe in October of last year, prior to the development of his renal cell carcinoma. Prior to that trip, he did have symptoms which were found to be heartburn, for which he received a stress echocardiogram. We have the report with us today,  which demonstrates no evidence of stress-induced wall motion abnormalities.     Mr. Gass underwent routine echocardiography on 05/01/2011, which had demonstrated a mild decrement in left ventricular systolic function with no other significant abnormalities. EF quantified by MOD was approximately 45% on that examination. Notably, the echocardiogram images were relatively poor.     He was subsequently referred to us for evaluation of possible tyrosine kinase associated left ventricular systolic dysfunction and evaluation and management for the same.     Review of Systems: A 14-point review of systems was negative except as noted above.     Medical History:   1.  Hypertension.   2.  Renal cell carcinoma with metastases involving the brain, neck, proximal humerus, and skull base.     Current Medications:   1.  Sunitinib 50 mg daily   2.  Amlodipine 10 mg a day.   3.  Lisinopril 20 mg a day.   4.  Cosopt.   5.  Pantoprazole.   6.  Nystatin.   7.  Zoledronic acid once monthly.   8.  Travoprost.     Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.     Family History: The patient's mother had renal cell carcinoma. Father had prostate carcinoma. Sister has breast cancer. There is no history of premature cardiovascular disease in the family.     Social History: The patient currently lives Visalia with his wife and has several children and grandchildren who live in the Pacific Northwest. He is a former pipe smoker for approximately 1 year. Never smoked cigarettes or cigars. He has mild to moderate routine alcohol with approximately 2 drinks per night.     Physical Examination: Blood pressure today was 140/90, rechecked 130/88 manually, respirations 16, pulse 65, 191 pounds, height 5-foot-9, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. General: Well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx was clear. Neck: No jugular venous distention is apparent on my exam.  Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs are appreciated. The patient is warm peripherally. Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. Extremities: Warm and well perfused. No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Abdomen: No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly on my exam.     Relevant laboratory testing: The patient has a creatinine as of early May of 1.1, potassium 4, sodium 138, hemoglobin of 13, BNP of 290, troponin I is undetectable, and free T4 of 1.1 with a TSH of 4.49. Cardiovascular Investigations: The patient had an EKG performed today which demonstrates sinus rhythm with normal axis and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a QRS duration of 124 msec. Other intervals are unremarkable. No ST or T wave changes noted. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on 05/01/2025 demonstrates normal left ventricular systolic size with mildly diminished left ventricular systolic ejection fraction of approximately 45%. Mild TR and MR appreciated. RVSP estimated was approximately 42 with a right atrial pressure of 15 estimated on this exam.     Impression and Plan: Mr. Gass is a 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with multiple metastatic lesions. He has currently had a relatively encouraging treatment response on sunitinib therapy as an adjunct to local radiation and CyberKnife treatment. We understand that he is to undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy to be performed sometime in the next few weeks. His current LV systolic dysfunction is almost certainly due to tyrosine kinase inhibition given that he has normal stress echocardiograms, and he has had no interval change in symptoms between that an the initiation of his therapy. His systolic dysfunction, however, is admittedly quite mild, and we would attempt to medically manage him just prior to discontinuing sunitinib therapy, given his dramatic response  to the same. Therefore, we have initiated carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily and increased his lisinopril to 40 mg daily for improved neurohormonal blockade and afterload reduction, respectively. He will have labs performed in approximately 1 week, and these will be faxed to our office. Any adjustments that are necessary will be performed at that time.     We will, thus, see Mr. Gass Dirks in our clinic in approximately 3 weeks with echocardiogram to be performed at that time to reevaluate left ventricular systolic function. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions. Thank you for your kind referral and the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient.

He is a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed likely renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the skull base and brain.     History of Present Illness: On 01/28/2011, he had sudden onset of diplopia and saw an ophthalmologist who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was seen by you on 02/03/2011, and you ordered an MRI on the same day of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by  carcinoma, likely renal primary. On 02/06/2011, the case was discussed at head and neck tumor board with the recommendation for patient to be evaluated by neuro radiation oncology, and urology medical oncology, who he has not seen yet. He has a PET CT scheduled later today and CT CAP tomorrow. He is here today to discuss the role of radiosurgery. Subjectively, he continues to have diplopia, and uses a left eye patch, left eye achiness, intermittent slight nasal stuffiness, and  denies headaches or other neurological symptoms.     Allergies: No known drug allergies.    Medications: Cosopt OP, Xalatan drops, Norvasc.    Past Medical/Surgical History: Glaucoma, hypertension, hernia, tonsillectomy.     Social History: He lives with his wife in Visalia, denies smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally.     Family History: Mother-renal cancer. Father-prostate cancer.     Review of Systems: As noted in the HPI. The rest of the 14-point system review is negative.    Physical Examination: General: A pleasant man in no acute distress. KPS 80. Vital Signs: BP 170/80, P 87, height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 87.8 kg. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. PERRL, sluggish on the left. Diplopia in all gazes.  Left eye patch. Left 6th nerve palsy. Left eye slight deviation. Oropharynx clear. Neck: Supple. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Bowel sounds present. Soft, nontender. No organomegaly. Extremities: Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin: Warm and dry. Neurologic: Alert and oriented, with fluent speech. Cranial nerves 2-12 intact, except for left 6th nerve palsy. Sensation intact to light touch. Visual fields full to confrontation. Motor strength 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. DTRs 2+ throughout. Gait, Steady. Tandem walk, intact.    Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the orbits, face and neck of 02/03/2011, which showed an enhancing mass involving the midline nasopharynx, right fossa of Rossenmuller, clival extension, sphenoid sinus and medial cavernous sinus bilaterally. There are enhancing intraparenchymal brain lesions, left parietal (series 16, image 13), left frontal (series 16, image 18), right frontal (series 16, image 8).     Laboratories: Outside Creatinine on 01/29/2011, 0.9 mg/dL.    Summary: Raghava Paredes is a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed likely renal cell carcinoma  metastatic to the skull base and brain, here to discuss radiosurgery. He anticipates urology medical oncology appointment and has a PET CT later today. We discussed with the patient and wife that the clival nasopharyngeal and intraparynchemal brain lesions are likely metastases from renal cell cancer. We explained to them that in general systemic treatment does not cross the blood brain barrier and treatment options include whole brain irradiation including the nasopharynx, 4-5 weeks of external beam radiotherapy; or stereotactic radiosurgery to the nasopharynx and the intraparenchymal brain metastases. We discussed with them that renal cell carcinoma is historically radio-resistant and for this reason we favor stereotactic radiosurgery, and defer side effects of whole brain irradiation. In addition, treatment with radiosurgery now would make it easier to plan for whole brain irradiation should he need this in the future. The rationale, benefits, logistics, and risks including, but not limited to, radiation edema, esophagitis, epistaxis, or nasal dryness. All questions were answered to their satisfaction and informed consent was obtained. We recommend follow up brain MRIs every 3 months after Cyberknife treatment.     A stereotactic MRI will be obtained and he was given Dexamethasone prescription to see if this helps with the diplopia. We will follow up with urology medical oncology regarding an appointment in hopes that he can be seen prior to Cyberknife treatment.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the medical care of Mr. Paredes Should there be further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Overall, he has been feeling significantly better and much stronger. He is on denosumab for his hypercalcemia, and started everolimus in late January. He says he is overall tolerating this well, but has some fatigue on it.     He says his breathing is much better at this point,  that most of the time it is not limiting him.     He apparently had some diarrhea with everolimus and has been following with Dr. Glidden, who has been closely following his labs and found and increase in his potassium, up to 6, and an increase in his creatinine up to 1.9 with a significant bump in his BUN as well to 88. In this context, Dr. Zito stopped his potassium supplementation and benazepril, and he is instead on hydralazine and Imdur.     He denies any dizziness, syncope or presyncope, and is not currently having any diarrhea or other GI symptoms.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented in the Epic documentation below. Comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.   Mr. Mcsweeney had an echo performed today. This revealed normal LV size with systolic function at the lower limits of normal with an EF measured at 56%. He has mild mitral insufficiency and up to moderately severe tricuspid insufficiency with an RVSP of 45 mmHg based on right atrial pressure of 5.     Compared to his prior study in December, the LV function has increased from 29% to 56%. The amount of TR and RVSP has increased from what was mild TR and RVSP of 25 mmHg.     Review of Mr. Diggs labs from 01/20/2025, include hemoglobin of 9.0, sodium 137, potassium 6.0, chloride 112, bicarbonate 19, BUN and creatinine of 88 and 1.89 respectively. He then had followup labs on 01/24/2025 with a sodium of 137, potassium 5.2, BUN and creatinine of 77 and 1.8 respectively. I also have a report of an outside echo, performed at Kaweah Delta, which reported an EF of 61% with RVSP of 44 mmHg. In the physician interpretation as opposed to the measurement, it was noted that the EF looked more in the 40% to 45% range.     We interrogated Mr. Pursley pacemaker today. Since 01/05/2025, he has had no atrial or ventricular arrhythmias recorded. He is 57% A sensed V sensed, and 43% A paced V  sensed, in MVP mode with lower rate of 60.     Overall, I am pleased to see that Mr. Sridhar Mcglynn systolic function is so much better. Looking at the images, I suspect it is because he is no longer being RV paced, as he appeared quite dyssynchronous on his last echo when he was being paced, and on our check at that time, he had been 84% ventricularly paced, usually because of complete heart block. It actually is not clear to me why he has had improvement in his AV conduction, but clearly this is in his favor. Given this and given how much he has had an improvement in his EF, I am actually going to decrease his carvedilol from 12.5 mg b.i.d. to 6.25 mg b.i.d. to try to help with AV conduction, which is probably of more importance to him than being on a higher dose of carvedilol. Otherwise, I am not planning to make any changes and he will continue to follow up with his local nephrologist with close attention to his potassium and creatinine. I certainly concur with the decision to take him off benazepril and potassium supplementation and replace him with hydralazine and nitrates instead.     I will plan to have him come back at 4 months' time with an echo to make sure that his LV function has not once again declined in the setting of his current cancer therapy, as well as a pacer check at that time.     Thank you very much for allowing me to take part in Mr. Moller care.             Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Claiborne Ohashi 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid  soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Munro Mohapatra/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.  Since 03/17/2025,2012 takes 2 weeks on and 1 week off.  07/04/2012: pacemaker placed    Interval History:  Has had issues with Renal function with creatinine being elevated and has had his meds held and labs checked periodically by Dr Witteles group. He was hospitalized 10/16-10/19 at Kaweah Delta for dehdration, ARF and severe diarrhea and tested positive for C diff.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base  MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Kiley for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Drs. Chang saw him 04/27/2012 and is happy with his continued response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior nasopharynx that has remained stable for some time, and encompasses the eustachian tube. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time.He will see him in 9/12 with another MRI of brain.     Overall the patient was doing well with Sutent, however, he is having some significant side effects today, namely diarrhea and acute renal failure.  lWe will restage him and decide if we should switch therapy; There are many std of care drugs as well as clinical trials that he might be a candidate for    Regarding his bradycardia and PPM, we will contact Dr. Bano for follow-up appointment in cardiology.    Otherwise, we will plan to see the patient back in 3 weeks.

He underwent treatment for his clivus metastasis as well as a total of 3 intraparenchymal brain metastasis. This treatment was performed in 5 sessions from 02/17/2011, through 02/21/2011.     Tumor #1 was his clivus metastasis. This was treated with 27.5 Gy delivered to the 80% isodose line using a 15 and 20 mm collimator over 5 sessions. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 34.38 Gy. The volume treated was 30. 73 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 38 x 49 x 38 mm.     Tumor #2 was a left frontal metastasis. This was treated with 24 Gy delivered to the 79% isodose line in a single session. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 30.38 Gy. The volume treated was 0.307  mL, treated lesion dimensions were 8 x 10 x 7 mm.     Tumor #3 was a left parietal metastasis. This was treated with 24 Gy delivered to the 84% isodose line in a single session. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 28.57 Gy. The volume treated was 0.08 mL and treated lesion dimensions were 5 x 5 x 5 mm.     Tumor #4 was a right temporal lobe metastasis. This was treated with 24 Gy delivered to the 85% isodose line in a single session. The maximal dose within the center of the treatment volume was 28.24 Gy delivered through a 7.5 mm collimator. The volume treated was 0.08 mL, treated lesion dimensions were 5 x 6 x mm. The patient tolerated his procedure well. I have ordered a followup MRI scan of his brain including a skull base protocol in 3 months.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient. Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions regarding my care of this patient or if I can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

His metastatic disease originally involved the nasopharynx/clivus/cavernous sinus as well as brain metastases and left femoral neck. He initially received radiation therapy, including cyberknife, to these lesions in 03/04/2011.  He was then started on Sutent and continued on this until a new liver metastasis was found in 11/04/2012.  He was then switched to pazopanib, but due to intercurrent illness and symptoms of diarrhea, this was held 2 days ago, and thus he has not had a true trial on this medication yet.    In the last several months he has had multiple issues.  First he developed C. Diff in mid-October and was hospitalized.  He was treated with Flagyl, and then had a recurrence of diarrhea and was treated with an additional 3 weeks of Flagyl.  He was then prescribed an additional 2 weeks of oral vancomycin.  His diarrhea finally resolved about 2 days ago and he has not had a bowel movement since then.  This correlates both with the completion of his course of vancomycin and discontinuation of his pazopanib (and also possibly with a contribution of his hypercalcemia).  He also had shortness of breath and has a unilateral pleural effusion treated by thoracentesis in late November.  No testing was done to evaluate if this was exudative or transudative, but the fluid was light red and negative for malignancy by cytology.    Finally, he had progressive functional decline over the past several weeks.  He was seen by his cardiologist, Dr. Engler How 12/01/2012 who noted that serum calcium was up to 12.4 with corrected Ca of 13.7 with elevated creatinine.  Given his other constitutional symptoms he was advised to present to the ER for management of hypercalcemia.  His calcium was 9.9 on 12/5 with creatinine of 1.3 on 12/5.  Notably, he had been  receiving Zometa and then switched to Xgeva for his bony disease.  However, his last dose of Xgeva was in September.    He was admitted to the General Medicine service on 12/01/2012, as Oncology (Med X) was full.  He was hydrated and his symptoms and calcium are improving.

Diff infection or newly started pazopanib.  His is quickly improving with hydration alone.      The largest contributor to his current illness is likely his dehydration due to diarrhea.  Given the timing of events, and the fact that he has been battling his diarrhea well before starting pazopanib, I suspect that his C. Diff alone is the cause of his diarrhea and not the pazopanib. Regardless, I have advised that he continue to hold the pazopanib for the next few days and to contact Dr. Harmon after he leaves the hospital when he restarts.  If he does develop recurrent diarrhea that times with restarting pazopanib then this would be much more concerning for a medication-related side effect.  Should he have relapsed c. diff in the future, he  should be treated with PO vancomycin as he has failed Flagyl twice.    We had attempted to give a dose of denusomab (which he had been receiving in the outpatient setting) but this could not be approved as an inpatient.  He therefore receive pamidronate because of his renal insufficiency.      -Continue treatment for hypercalcemia; s/p pamidronate 12/02/2012.  Monitor volume status and can administer furosemide if needed.  -Hold pazopanib; plan to restart after discharge to allow for recovery from illness to allow a clear determination of side effects  -Plan to continue monthly denosumab as an outpatient  -Weekly labs initially after discharge for calcium, patient can get these done at ITA or else locally and faxed to Dr. Parekh  -Patient should call to reschedule appointment with Dr. Carrier after discharge    Patient was discussed with Dr. Mathai Knickerbocker, outpatient primary oncologist.    Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions or concerns.  Thank you for your excellent care of this patient.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.  Biopsy of nasopharyngeal/clival mass on 02/04/2011.  He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Gosling for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     In the past 2 weeks had several episodes of epistaxis.   Started aspirin last month.  Also noted some drainage from R ear.    PET SCAN 01/04/2013  IMPRESSION:    1.

The last three days it has been quite high: 182/91. Then last night it jumped to 209/107. We saw our local Nephrologist yesterday and he was concerned about the 180/90 readings and increased Dick Hydralazine 50 mg tablets to 3 times a day.. Last night his blood pressure was 209/107. Dr. Gosselin Stucky concerned because of the medications he is currently taking can raise   BP:  1. Antibiotics for a bacterial infection ( he has 3 more days of Sulfamethoxazole and Cephalexin)  2. Steriod for his swelling- Dexamethasone  3. Yesterday was the first treatment of 15 radiation treatments for spots detected in his brain.   4. Do Epogen shots increase BP?    Is there anything we can do to lower his BP. He will take the additional tablet of the Hydralazine today. Can we stop the antibiotic?    Thank you for your help.

This is an extremely pleasant 70-year-old gentleman with a history of renal cell carcinoma, treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastasis to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus and cavernous sinus region. He also had a frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis and right temporal metastasis treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2011, and 02/18/2025 to 02/21/2011. He received external beam radiation to 20 Gy to his left femoral neck metastasis from 02/19/2025 to 02/25/2011.     Symptomatically, he is doing well. He has had no new pains or headaches. I saw him informally on 01/16/2012, at which time there was some question of interval progression of the clival disease with extension into the right side of the clivus and probable extension to the right Meckel's cave. He was due for a PET scan, which he has since had, on 01/14/2012. We added the brain for that PET scan. That PET scan revealed that the area in the clivus region was hypometabolic, not concerning for tumor. He is here to discuss the PET results.    On examination, blood pressure 130/64, pulse 48, temperature 98, respirations 18. KPS 90%. He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination 2 through 12 intact to detailed testing. He has hearing aids bilaterally. Full strength in the upper and lower extremities with normal tone and bulk. Sensory examination intact to light touch. Reflexes symmetric Gait examination narrow based and steady.     I personally reviewed his PET scan taken on 01/14/2012, revealing stable disease. We reviewed the PET scan with him in great detail, as well as the MRI scan of the skull base taken on 12/30/2011, and referencing the PET scan.    Mr. Jin  is a 70-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the clivus, as well as left parietal, left frontal and right temporal lobe. His disease appears stable to smaller overall except for the clival region. However, the PET of the brain reveals stable findings. We feel confident in following him with another MRI scan of the skull base using fat and contrast in 3 months' time or sooner should new problems develop.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in Idris Jin's care. It was a pleasure seeing him in my clinic today.

As you recall, Mr. Baek is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history of renal cell carcinoma and metastasis to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus and cavernous sinus region. He also had a frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis and right temporal metastasis treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2011, and 02/18/2025 to 02/21/2011. He received external beam radiation to 20 Gy to his left femoral neck metastasis from 02/19/2025 to 02/25/2011. I last saw him on 01/16/2012, for clinical exam and review of MRI scan that was concerning for interval progression of the clival disease with extension into the right side of the clivus and probable extension to the right Meckel's cave. We recommended a PET scan of the head that was completed on 01/14/2012, and he is here today for those results.      On physical exam, he is well appearing in no acute distress. Blood pressure is 130/64, pulse 48, temperature 98, respirations 18. He is alert and oriented. Speech clear. Thought process coherent. Neurologic exam is nonfocal with the exception of bilateral decreased hearing for which he has bilateral hearing aids. He is unable to hear finger rub and unable to discerned whispered words bilaterally. Otherwise, his neurologic exam is nonfocal.     I personally reviewed his PET scan dated 01/14/2012, that demonstrates the area in the clivus region was hypometabolic, not concerning for tumor, or disease progression.    Mr. Baek is a 70-year-old gentleman with history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma from renal cell carcinoma, status post CyberKnife radiosurgery in 02/04/2011. He has a  history of left femoral neck metastasis treated with conventional radiotherapy, 02/19/2025 through 02/25/2011. At this time, I am happy with his continued response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior nasopharynx that encompasses the eustachian tube, and has remained stable for some time. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time. We continue to follow Mr. Baek and have ordered another MRI in 3 months' time and request he return to clinic at that time as well. Also instructed him to contact us should he have any new or worsening symptoms.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of Alva Baek. Please feel free to contact me should you have any additional questions or concerns regarding the care of him or any other patient requiring neurosurgical intervention.

He was diuresed in the hospital. Pazopanib discontinued.    01/06/2013: Everolimus 10 mg po daily prescribed    Oncology History: The patient is a 71 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Leger Shiu 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional  submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by clear cell carcinoma (PAX2+, PAX8+, CK+), likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Hankins Marotta/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.  Since 03/17/2025,2012 takes 2 weeks on and 1 week off.  07/04/2012: pacemaker placed    10/05/2012 sutent discontinued due to hospitalization for ARF and c diff colitis.  Hospitalized from 10/05/2012 - 10/08/2012.    10/22/2012 new liver lesion on PET/CT.

He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastasis in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. 08/29/2012 MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Seifert for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma. His metastatic RCC progressed in liver on PET-CT of 10/22/2012. Pazopanib 800 mg po daily was begun on or about 11/08/2012 when his diarrhea had resolved.  On 11/19/2012 he underwent a Right Thoracentesis by Stanford IR, pathology was negative for malignancy.  HE was admitted to the hospital 12/04/2012 with hypercalcemia and pazopanib was decreased to 4400mg Po QDay. However, he then had acute decompensated heart failure, and pazopanib was discontinued. He was started on Everolimus 10mg QDay 01/06/2013 and has been tolerating it well.    03/07/2013 MRI Brain:  Worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 28 enhancing intraparenchymal lesions both supratentorially and infratentorially.    03/08/2013: Evaluated by Stanford Radiation Oncology:  These lesions are too numerous to be treated with CyberKnife therapy, therefore whole brain radiation therapy recommended.He was referred to ED for left hand injury to be evaluated for infection before steroids begun.

Dick has continued to have higher blood pressure and swelling in his feet, ankles, and legs. Dr Witteles thought it a good idea to come in to see him since Dick has also had shortness of breath. We have an appointment with Dr Witteles today, Wednesday, at 12:30.    Flagyl. Dick has one more day of the medication for C-Diff. The diarrhea has been much better for the last two weeks, soft stool but not watery. Today for some reason he had the diarrhea again. Not sure what to think about that! When Do you want us to start the Votrient?(Pazanonib).    Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving break,    Thanks for all your help.    Marilyn (Mre.

Based on Dr. Conant Lamar from your last clinic visit, you can start taking Pazopanib the new prescription after your diarrhea stopped. However, I would suggest him to take a few days break (maybe till after Thanksgiving)before start this new treatment-Pazopanib.   I think it's very important for him to advance his diet and gain some strength back after all the C-diff infection.    Dr. Proffitt is out of country for vacation. She will be back on 11/26. We can consult with her then to make sure it's okay for Mr. Potts Moor start the new prescription.    Thank you.  Have a wonderful holiday!

He is still taking the Flagyl and the diarrhea has stopped (for the last five days). He still has a couple of weeks supply. So much better!! When do you want him to start taking the new prescription.    He also saw a Physical Therapist, Larry Nava, here in Visalia. He did an evaluation on Dick and confirmed that he is indeed weak. He will work with him twice a week in hopes to strengthen his muscles - especially his thigh muscle!! In the last five months he has lost considerable - I don't know if it is because of the pacemaker, the medicine, the C-Dff.. but it's scary how unstable he is. He has been fairly inactive (no golf) because he just didn't feel good or his feet hurt...but it has taken its toll!    We hope you have a nice weekend and Thanksgiving.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, discontinued it 10/04/2012 due to hospitalization for acute renal failure and c. Diff colitis, and is here for follow-up. About 11/19//12 began Pazopanib 800 mg daily, this was decreased to 400 mg daily after hospital admission mid-12/04/2012 and then discontinued in early 01/04/2013 due to his heart failure.

He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Fabela Iverson 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There  was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by clear cell carcinoma (PAX2+, PAX8+, CK+), likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Nickerson Dhawan/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 71 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastasis in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. 08/29/2012 MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Eyre for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma. His metastatic RCC progressed in liver on PET-CT of 10/22/2012. Pazopanib 800 mg po daily was begun on or about 11/08/2012 when his diarrhea had resolved.  On 11/19/2012 he underwent a Right Thoracentesis by Stanford IR, pathology was negative for malignancy.  HE was admitted to the hospital 12/04/2012 with hypercalcemia and pazopanib was decreased to 4400mg Po QDay. However, he then had acute decompensated heart failure, and pazopanib was discontinued. He was started on Everolimus 10mg QDay 01/06/2013 and has been tolerating it well. He presents to clinic for follow up, and with a baseline PET scan done 01/18/2013    # Metastatic RCC  - Cont everolimus, tolerating well except for fatigue and diarrhea  - baseline scan as above, will upload final images and result in our system.    # Heart Failure  - Cont to f/u with Dr. Shahani    # Hyperkalemia: will have him re draw his BMP with his nephrologist in Visalia for for follow up. Advised low potassium foods.    # Hypercalcemia: resolved, will hold denosumab today    # Anemia: is followed by a nephrologist in Visalia and is on erythropoietin injections. Will advise that he follow up with a  Repeat lab draw and consider transfusion early next week.       # neuro:  He  has had intermittant diplopia since treatment: 9/12 MRI did not show any recurrence, and 11/2 PETCT did not show any gross recurrence (PET/CT is not a sensitive test for brain mets).  Scheduled in neuro with brain MRI 3/13 and will contact either neuro or Dr. Cahoon if any significant changes develop.      RTC in 4 weeks.

Identification: Sher Sacks is a 70-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma, with metastasis to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus, and cavernous sinus region, as well as left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal metastasis treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery from 02/09/2011 to 02/21/2011.    Last Clinic Visit: 01/28/2012.    Interval History: Mr. Sacks Zaragoza last seen in our clinic in 02/04/2012. In the interim, he has been followed by Dr. Rust Sakai in Neurosurgery, most recently in 09/04/2012.     He has recently had a run of hospitalizations, including a visit to the emergency department in 12/04/2012, for weakness and hypercalcemia with a pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis to pull off a 3.5 L of fluid in his chest. Cytology was negative, though progression of his malignancy could not be excluded. In 11/04/2012, he had a PET-CT, which showed disease progression with new metastases to the liver. He was therefore started on pazopanib by Dr. Latif, which he tolerated poorly and ended up hospitalized at an outside institution with decompensated heart failure. His last measured ejection fraction was 29%.     In 01/04/2013, he was switched to everolimus (Afinitor) and has been taking denosumab for hypercalcemia and presumed bone metastases. The patient reports his  most recent PET-CT at an outside facility, on 01/18/2013, was stable.     Today, Mr. Sacks presents accompanied by his wife. An MRI done yesterday shows worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 28 enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, as well as increased enhancement of the previously treated clival based lesion, though it is not noticeably larger.     Symptomatically, Mr. Sacks is doing well. His diplopia is stable, though he has had some unsteadiness for the past 2-3 weeks and had a fall 8 days ago, during which he sustained a laceration to his left hand. He saw his primary care physician last week and was given instructions to follow up in 1 week if it failed to heal. There is now significant swelling around the wound, involving his digits and extending up to the wrist. He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or other systemic symptoms. The area is nonpainful, and he has not lost any function or sensation in that hand.    Review Of Systems: A 14 point review of systems was negative, except as noted above in the HPI.    Social History: He resides with his wife in Visalia. He does not use tobacco and occasionally uses alcohol.    Medications:   1. Everolimus 10 mg p.o. daily.  2. Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.  3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.  4. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.a.m.  5. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.  6. Epogen injections weekly.  7. Folic acid supplement.  8. Synthroid 125 mcg daily.    Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 180/80, P 64. General: Well-appearing, healthy, robust gentleman in no acute distress KPS 90. HEENT: Head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Sclerae nonicteric. Hearing is grossly intact.  Mucous membranes are moist. Neck is soft and supple. No adenopathy or thyromegaly. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate, rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Extremities:  Warm and well perfused. On his left hand, on the volar aspect, just proximal to the 5th digit, is a 2 cm laceration with a modest amount of associated pus and swelling extending proximally to the wrist and distally involving his 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits. There is no warmth or pain. His strength and sensation are intact in this extremity. Neuro: Cranial nerves 2-12 are intact. There are no detectable abnormalities of his gaze. Strength and sensation are intact throughout, including in the left hand, as previously mentioned.    Imaging: MRI done yesterday, 03/07/2013, was independent reviewed by us and shows worsening metastatic disease with interval development of over a dozen new enhancing intraparenchymal lesions on the T1 post-contrast image. There is also increased enhancement without change in morphology of the previously treated clival based lesion. His previously treated left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal lobe intraparenchymal metastases are no longer visible. There is a significant amount of associated edema at multiple locations on the T2 FLAIR weighted images, but no mass effect.

The most recent MRI shows progression of the intracranial disease with numerous enhancing metastatic brain lesions, which are mostly subcentimeter though a few measure up to 1.5 cm in size. These lesions are too numerous to be treated with CyberKnife therapy, and we have therefore recommended whole brain radiation therapy to 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions. Given the relative radioresistence of this histology, we would reconsider radiosurgery boost of tumors that are not stabilized by whole brain irradiation at a later time.    The associated side effects of whole brain radiation include local alopecia, which is temporary, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. There is also the risk of further intracranial swelling, which can cause headache and neurologic symptoms. Post radiation somnolence syndrome is occasionally seen and usually resolves. There is a risk for neuro cognitive defects, especially memory and executive functions, endocrinopathies, and secondary cancers.     The edema associated with the parieto-occipital lesions is quite extensive.  However, given the absence of mass effect and midline shift, we do not believe there is a surgical indication of these lesions. While our initial preference is to treat the edema with steroids; the left hand wound appears to be possibly infected and of immediate concern. Steroids in the context of this likely untreated infection could be dangerous. We have referred him to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and management of the left hand wound.    Mr. Sacks would prefer to receive the recommended radiotherapy closer to home near Visalia,CA and we agree that this is a reasonable decision. We have referred him to,    Sequoia Regional Cancer Center  4945 W Cypress Ave, Visalia,  CA 93277   Phone (559) 624-3100     We would like him to follow up with us in 2 months. He will have an MRI at that time.     Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient. Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions or concerns.

He is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history renal cell carcinoma  with metastasis to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus and cavernous sinus region. He also had left frontal, left parietal and right temporal metastasis. These were all treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery from 02/09/2011, to 02/21/2011. His last clinic visit with me was 04/27/2012, at which point all lesions were stable. Since his last clinic visit, the patient overall reports he has been doing reasonably well. He denies any specific seizures or cognitive difficulty. He has had occasional trace headaches but nothing significant.     On examination today, blood pressure 153/89, pulse 69, weight was 77.1 kg, height 1.74 m. Pain was 0 on a scale of 0/10 while in clinic today. Neurologic exam revealed that he was awake and alert and able to follow commands well. Cranial nerves 2-12 were bilaterally intact. Motor exam revealed 5/5 strength in all extremities. Sensory exam was intact to light touch. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric throughout and gait was normal.     Overall, I am pleased with the patient's response to date.     I reviewed the patient's MRI scan obtained earlier today. This shows stability in his intracranial and skull based lesions. Of note, he only was able to obtain a noncontrast MRI scan due to elevated creatinine levels above 2.5.     I discussed these radiographic findings with the patient. I have recommended that we undergo a followup MRI scan of his brain in 6 months. The patient will obtain that study and return my clinic once the study is completed.     Thank for allowing me to participate in care of your patient. Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions regarding my care of Finlay, or if I can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

He is a 69-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery for metastases to the skull base and brain 8 months ago. Specifically, a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastasis was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025-8th, 2011. He was last seen in followup in this department on 07/04/2011 at which time he was radiographically stable.     A repeat MRI of the skull base was performed earlier today. The formal radiology report is pending. Additionally, a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed today, and he is planning to discuss the results with Dr. Biagini Bolt the medical oncology department tomorrow. He continues Sutent, which he is tolerating well.     Symptomatically, Mr. Geller continues to report occasional episodes of diplopia noted when looking to the far left. He has known bilateral middle ear/mastoid effusions  and underwent a recent audiogram, showing bilateral mixed hearing loss, primarily conductive. It was recommended that he treat the hearing loss conservatively with hearing aids before considering PE tube placement. He also reports cold intolerance, currently is maintained on Synthroid 50 mcg daily and underwent a repeat TSH today, with an elevated result of 6.14.   He further reports that his skin is thin and tears easily the past 4 months. He denies additional complaints. The pain within the left hip and leg has completely resolved.     Allergies: NKDA.     Medications: Coreg, nystatin oral suspension, Pepcid, Synthroid, lisinopril, Zometa, Protonix, Sutent, Cosopt ophthalmic drops, Xalatan Ophthalmic Drops, Norvasc.     Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man in no acute distress. KPS 80. Temperature 36.9, pulse 53, blood pressure 153/83. Weight 83.6 kg. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx clear. He is wearing hearing aids bilaterally. Neck supple. Breathing unlabored. Skin warm and dry, with bruising to the right hand and forearm. Neurologic Examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact to detailed testing. Motor strength 5/5 within the upper and lower extremities. Sensation intact to light touch. Gait steady. Tandem walk intact.     Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier today, which was compared to prior imaging from 07/04/2011 and 02/14/2011. The treated left frontal metastasis is barely seen on the current examination (series 12, image 25). The treated right temporal and left parietal metastases are no longer seen. The nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous metastasis remains stable. Mastoid disease has increased since February, and is slightly worse when compared to imaging performed in July. No new intracranial metastatic disease is identified. Review of today's CT scan shows  the left femoral neck metastasis has interval subtle improvement.     Summary: Rohit Geller is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal carcinoma who remains radiographically stable 8 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are identified. Symptomatically, he continues to report occasional episodes of diplopia when looking to the far left, though has no new neurologic complaints.   We have asked that he return to this clinic with a repeat MRI in 3 months. In the interim, he will follow up with the medical oncology department tomorrow to discuss the results of today's CT scan.   Additionally he states that his Synthroid is managed by the medical oncology department, and will discuss the elevated TSH result with him tomorrow.

The following is a concise summary of his treatment.    Identification: Maynard Delcarlo is a 69-year-old man with a nasopharynx/clival/sphenoid mass, and an intraparenchymal brain lesion confirmed to be metastatic renal cell carcinoma on biopsy of the clivus. Further workup identified other metastatic sites including a left femoral neck lesion. The patient recently received radiosurgery to the nasopharynx and clivus mass, as well as the parenchymal brain metastasis. We treated him with prophylactic palliative external beam radiotherapy to his left femoral neck. This treatment summary relates to his course of external beam radiotherapy.    Course: The patient tolerated the treatment well without any unanticipated side effects. His femoral neck lesion was not symptomatic prior to radiation, and did not bother him throughout the course. He will follow up with Sandhya Srinivas in medical oncology and will have a repeat MR of the brain and nasopharynx in 6-8 weeks' time to evaluate response.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for follow-up.    LCV:  06/16/2012    Oncology History: The patient is a 70 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Armour Bills 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid  soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Neumann Todd/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.  Since 03/17/2025,2012 takes 2 weeks on and 1 week off.    Interval History:  The patient has had a few events since his last visit.  On 06/23/2012, the patient was not feeling well with lethargy, and checked his BP at home and found his heart rate to be in the 30s.  He then went to the emergency room in Vasallia, where his HR was as low as 25.  He was admitted to the hospital, and eventually had placement of a pacemaker.  The patient has been feeling much more energetic since that time, although he has not had routine follow-up with cardiology since then.  He also has had progressive diarrhea for the last few months, most recently with bowel movements about 10 times per day.  They are loose or liquid.  He does not have any fevers or chills or abdominal pain associated with this.  His wife notes that the diarrhea seems to be associated with food, and that he is not eating or drinking much.  He is not routinely taking imodium.      Otherwise he is taking is sutent and is tolerating fairly well.  He continues to take this two weeks on one week off.  He does have a blister over his right foot, and some changes to the skin of his hands.  Otherwise feeling well with a good energy  level.  He has poor appetite.  No pain.  No N/V, no chest pain or shortness of breath.  He does have some leg swelling.  He has a new left hydrocele.  A 14 point ROS is otherwise negative.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Dole for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Drs. Chang saw him 04/27/2012 and is happy with his continued response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior nasopharynx that has remained stable for some time, and encompasses the eustachian tube. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time.He will see him in 9/12 with another MRI of brain.      Overall the patient is doing well with Sutent, however, he is having some significant side effects today, namely diarrhea and acute renal failure.  The patient is due for denosumab today, and will give 1L NS there as well.  We will have the patient try imodium to control his BMs.  If he is still having >5 BM per day, we will have him take a week break from Sutent, and then restart.    Regarding his renal failure, a bladder scan today showed 78cc PVR.  We will have him get a renal US closer to home.    Regarding his bradycardia and PPM, we will contact Dr. Denman for follow-up appointment in cardiology.    Otherwise, we will plan to see the patient back in 6 weeks.    PLAN:   - Denosumab and 1L NS today  - Renal ultrasound as outpatient to work-up renal failure  - Imodium for diarrhea.  If still >5 BM daily, patient should take a 1 week break from Sutent and then restart  - Follow-up with Dr. Steinberger Hoffman Cardiology  - RTC in 6 weeks for Sherman, MD, denosumab    Patient seen and discussed with Dr. Tonelli, Naing physician, who agrees with the above assessment and plan.

Hillsdale Avenue   Visalia, California 93291-8222     Jankowski Robeson MD    RE: Espino, Monico   MRN: 87495863  DOB: 12/02/1941    Dear Doctors:     Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Monico Espino in our CyberKnife Radiosurgery Clinic for an urgent followup. He is a 71-year-old gentleman who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment in 03/04/2011 to multiple brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. During his last clinic visit with us on 03/08/2013, a surveillance MRI scan demonstrated worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 20 enhancing intraparenchymal lesions in his brain. Due to the numerous lesions noted on his MRI scan, he was recommended to undergo whole brain radiation treatment which he recently completed locally in Visalia. California. Two weeks ago after completion of his radiation treatment, he acutely developed left upper extremity weakness. He was evaluated by his local radiation oncologist who ordered a CT scan of the head for which he brings a copy of the images today. A call was also made to Dr. Wessels  Vanpelt, MD in Radiation Oncology who recommended that the patient present today for an evaluation as well as undergo a new MRI scan. Symptomatically he reports weakness in the left upper extremity but has intact sensation. His wife reports increased fluid retention in his lower extremities, and severe weakness on both legs. He otherwise denies any other neurological symptoms. He denies any headaches, speech difficulties, changes in his cognition, vision changes. He has stable hearing loss on the left ear. She reports that his gait is slower and balance unsteady at times. He denies any other new concerning neurological symptoms. He is currently taking Decadron 4 mg bid.    Physical Examination: He is well appearing, in no acute distress. His weight is 198 pounds. His height is 5 feet 9  inches. Blood pressure 181/90, pulse 81, temperature 36.7 degrees centigrade. Speech is clear. Thought process coherent. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. There is slight movement of the fingers of the left hand.  He has decreased strength of the left handgrip and can only lift the left arm slightly. His motor strength is also diminished on his left lower extremity, 3/5. His right lower extremity is 4/5 strength and left lower extremity 5/5 strength. His gait is wide based and steady. Heel to toe balance exam deferred. He has swelling on the right hand from a previous hand injury. He has 4+ pitting edema of the lower extremities.     Dr. Gosnell reviewed his MRI scan taken today which is notable for edema surrounding the right motor cortex. There are no new lesions noted.     Mr. Espino Murakami is a 71-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma, status post CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment in 03/04/2011 for multiple brain metastasis and recently completed whole-brain radiation locally to additional brain metastasis completed a week ago with acute onset of left upper extremity plegia. It is likely that his LUE plegia is related to the surrounding edema to the right motor cortex; however, there is also a possibility that he may have pathology in the C spine that might explain his symptom. We therefore recommend that he undergo a C spine MRI today. He was sent to the ED for an evaluation and treatment of his hand injury that remains unhealed. Given that he has an MRI compatible Pacemaker, we have notified cardiology service for interrogation and reprogramming of his pacer post MRI.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

And Jeanette Powell Professor of Neurosurgery      Addendum: I personally discussed the natural history of the disease and possible interventions with the patient. The patient has symptoms of LUE plegia and RLE weakness. I reviewed radiographic films  with the patient and agree with the plan as outlined above. He is SP CK and Whole Brain radiation for numerous multiple brain metastasis from Renal Cell Cancer and recommend that he undergo a C spine MRI to further assess the cause of his symptoms.

As noted below, after the clinic and after I received his laboratory reports I sent him to the emergency room for admission.     Since I had last seen him 2 weeks prior, he has overall done poorly. He did have the thoracentesis which did provide him significant relief of dyspnea. 3.5 L was removed of apparently mildly red fluid. No biochemical testing was done on it other than a cytology which was negative for malignancy. He was started by Dr. Kale Gurevich pazopanib, which he was on for about 10 days, but felt quite poorly including profound fatigue and recently some worsening of his loose stools again (of course, with a recent history of Clostridium difficile infection, status post 2 treatment courses). His blood pressures on the pazopanib have also been on the higher side, mainly 140s to 160s over 90s.     He did switch his hydrochlorothiazide to Lasix as instructed last time with complete resolution of his edema. His appetite has overall been quite poor and his biggest complaint was of profound fatigue.     Current medications, physical examination are as documented in the Epic documentation below. Comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     Interrogation of his Medtronic pacemaker shows that he is atrially sensed 47% of the time, ventricularly paced 41% of the time. He has episodes that are marked on the AT/AF zone which were actually far field sensing and we, therefore, decrease the sensitivity to prevent the incorrect mode switching.     Overall, I was quite concerned about Mr. Friend appearance. He appeared, if anything, dry on exam and the blood pressure was a bit up today, though he did not have a dose of pazopanib today, and I had him continue the increased  amlodipine dose which was already at 10 mg a day, and planned to increase his carvedilol to 12.5 mg b.i.d. He did have exam evidence of pleural effusion as well. I talked to him about the fact that I thought that the cause of his effusion was fairly unlikely to be heart failure given the unilateral nature and the quick development of it as well his present effusion without being volume overloaded. I noted that though the cytology was negative, this by no means discounted malignancy as the cause, and he had an appointment the following day to meet with Dr. Feinstein Of note, he had lost 25 pounds of weight since I last saw him just a couple weeks ago, some of which was clearly related to fluid, but some of which was clearly related to loss of muscle mass as well, with my great concern that this could reflect a rapidly worsening malignancy which would go along with his effusion as well. I checked labs after clinic which were notable for a very elevated calcium of 12.1 with an albumin of 2.4. His BUN and creatinine were 40 and 2.3 respectively, which was a slight increase in his creatinine from his baseline. Of note, his calcium in November was 9.6, and on 10/12/2025 was 8.9. I suspect that the hypercalcemia is related to his malignancy and likely the result of bony metastases that he is known to have. I called him and told him to go to the emergency room and gave the emergency room information about his coming, and also spoke with the oncology fellow to let him know of Mr. Bhavsar impending visit to the emergency room. I tried to contact Dr. Quraishi but she was unavailable by page. I will follow him up as appropriate, of course, once he leaves the hospital, but I do not believe heart failure is the main issue at this point. Of note, he did have an echo today which showed that his EF has further decreased, though only mildly further with an EF that was read as 29%, down from 41% in August. Visually I do not believe  that the fall has been this dramatic. I think that part of the fall is likely from dyssynchrony from his RV pacing, as well as some from his preexistent LV dysfunction with a very possible component from his tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Nevertheless, again I think that his main cause of illness is less likely the heart failure and much more likely his progressive malignancy.

Since he was last here, he has continued on his sunitinib therapy 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off and finished his most recent cycle on Sunday and is due to restart the next one 11 days from now. He made the medication adjustments we recommended  last time, including starting the carvedilol for which he is now on 6.25 mg b.i.d. and increasing his lisinopril to 40 mg per day, and he remains on the amlodipine 10 mg a day as well. His home blood pressures (including when he was on the sunitinib) have mostly been in the 130s/high 70s. He denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or dizziness.     He did have an episode on this last Sunday when he developed a painful red swollen first toe on his right foot. He said that this remained bad for the next couple of days, although in the last 24 hours, it has somewhat improved, although is still somewhat tender. He said he wondered if it could be gout, though he has not had a history of gout or having this happen to him in the past.   Current medications and physical examination are as documented on the EPIC documentation below. Of note, on my manual recheck of his blood pressure, it was 142/84.     Mr. Razavi had an echocardiogram performed today. The final read is pending, but my review of it shows normal LV systolic function. Comparing it side by side to his 05/01/2025 echo, his LV systolic function appears to be improved (as it has been noted to be 45% at the time. Again, the final read is pending.     Overall, I am delighted that Mr. Elwood ejection fraction appears to have improved. His blood pressure control sounds better at home based on his home blood pressure readings. It is slightly higher than I would ideally like to see it today, particularly given that he is off the sunitinib, but given that his home readings are lower, I am asked him to continue to monitor it at home and if they start rising significantly above the low 140s systolic, asked him to call us and we would either increase his carvedilol or add a medication such as hydralazine.     Regarding his toe pain, the location is certainly classic for gout. He does not have any obvious gout risk factors. He is not on any diuretic therapy which could  have set off an attack as well. As he is seeing Dr. Banda tomorrow, I want her to see it before empirically treating it as gout in case she is concerned it could be related to his cancer therapy (though it certainly does not look like the hand/foot syndrome that could be seen with sunitinib). I also added a uric acid level onto tomorrow's labs, which, while not by any means diagnostic, particularly in the setting of an acute flare, if it is very high, it would be more suggestive of gout and if it is frankly normal, it would be less suggestive. If he is still having symptoms and Dr. Frew does not think it is related to the cancer or cancer therapy, I think it would be reasonable to treat him with colchicine for the flare.     I will plan to see him again in 6 months' time with an echo or sooner as is clinically indicated.     Thank you for allowing me to take part in the care of Mr. Razavi Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.     ADDENDUM: The final read on the echo did not report a significant improvement from prior, but on my direct visualization I believe there is an improvement and the LV systolic function is at worst minimally reduced from normal.

As you know, Mr. Mullen is a 69-year-old gentleman, whom 2 weeks ago presented to an ophthalmologist with diplopia. As you know, Mr. Mullen has a history of glaucoma. Head CT done revealed evidence of a fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx as well as a frontal lesion and a sphenoid sinus lesion. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck confirmed these lesions.On 02/04/2011, he underwent biopsy of the clival mass. Pathology was consistent with a metastatic renal cell carcinoma clear cell type. He has yet to meet with the medical uro-oncologist. PET CT and chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT will be completed tomorrow. He is here today to discuss the role of CyberKnife radiosurgery to his intracranial lesions. Symptomatically, he does have diplopia  which is improved with a left eye patch. He denies headaches, extremity weakness, or sensory changes.     Past Medical History: Significant for glaucoma, hypertension.     Surgical History: Significant for hernia repair and tonsillectomy.     Socially, he resides with his wife in Visalia. He denies tobacco use and reports occasional alcohol.     Family history is significant for mother with renal cancer and father with prostate cancer.     Current Medications: Include Vicodin p.r.n., Augmentin, Cosopt eyedrops, Xalatan eyedrops, and Norvasc 10 mg.     Review of Systems: Significant for diplopia, otherwise he denies any respiratory, psychiatric, pain, neurological, musculoskeletal, integumentary, hematologic, lymphatic, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, throat, constitutional, cardiovascular, or immunologic problems.     On examination he appears wearing an eye patch on his left eye. KPS is 80%. He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Blood pressure is 170/80, pulse 87. Height is 5 feet 9 inches tall. Weight is 87.8 kg. His cranial nerve examination is notable for left 6th nerve palsy, otherwise extraocular movements are intact. Otherwise facial sensation was intact. Visual fields are full to gross confrontation. Motor strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Gait was narrow based and steady with intact tandem.     I reviewed his MRI scan taken of the orbits, face, and neck dated 02/03/2011, which reveals a nodular soft tissue mass extending posteriorly from the midline nasopharynx and into the left clivus infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There is also evidence of a left frontal, right temporal, and left parietal lobe lesion.     Ameen Mullen is a 69-year-old gentleman with a newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma with intracranial metastasis. He is scheduled to undergo PET CT later today as well as CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for further workup. He  is a good candidate for CyberKnife radiosurgery of his intracranial lesions. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure were discussed with him and his wife when seen in clinic today. These risks include, but are not limited to failure to control tumor growth, failure to control systemic disease processes. He is aware of these risks and they wish to proceed. We will schedule him surrounding his other diagnostic studies and will treat him 5 sessions.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient. Please contact my office with additional questions or concerns regarding this patient or any other patient with neurosurgical disorders.

As you know, he is a pleasant 70-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction. He has been on sunitinib therapy since 03/04/2011, and has blood pressure recently while controlled on combination of 4 antihypertensives. His ejection fraction was noted in 01/04/2012, to be approximately 47%. He has continued on sunitinib since 02/22/2011, with recent  change in his dosing from 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off to 2 weeks on and 1 week off in an attempt to reduce his non-cardiovascular side-effects.     He symptomatically notes he is able to walk 9 of his 18 holes of golf and plays approximately 3 rounds per week with no significant complaints.     He notes that on home blood pressure monitoring, his blood pressure machine has been noting pulses as low as the mid 30s, with some variability in his blood pressure recording on repeated testing. EKG was performed today in clinic, which shows supraventricular bigeminy and a ventricular response rate of 64 beats per minute. He also has first degree AV block and right bundle branch block with left anterior fascicular block with a PR interval of 326 and QRS duration of 154. He  specifically denies any symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness or frank syncope and again notes no change in his exertional tolerance.     A complete 14-point review of systems was notable for complains of pinkish fluid that is draining from his nasopharynx. He notes some cold intolerance and easy bruising and bleeding when he cuts himself is difficult to control.    Allergies: He has no known drug allergies.    Current Medication: He is on Norvasc 10 mg once daily. He is taking carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily, Pepcid 20 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily, Synthroid 100 mcg daily, timolol eye drops, lisinopril 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg daily, sunitinib 50 mg, 2 weeks on 1 week off and Zometa IV. He states that he has recently increased his Synthroid from 75 to 100 mcg daily on the advise of Dr. Kilroy     Wine physical exam today, blood pressure 118/76, repeat 152/87, repeat by manual cuff averaging 126/84 with significant variability depending on his palpated pulse. His average pulse is 63, respirations 16, weight 84 kg, and height 5 feet 9 inches. Oxygen saturation 97% on room air. General: He is a well-appearing man in no acute distress. Appears his stated age. Oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes. Jugular venous pressure is not particularly elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is intermittently irregular with no significant murmurs, rubs, or gallops. PMI is not laterally displaced. Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended. Extremities are warm and well perfused with 2+ pulses bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities and no peripheral edema. Neurologically and psychiatrically appears appropriate and intact.     He underwent echocardiogram today, 04/07/2012, which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular size and mild to moderately reduced systolic function with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. There  is left atrial enlargement, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation with estimated RVSP of 32 mmHg. Compared to 12/30/2024, there is no significant change in his echocardiogram.     In recent laboratory testing, his sodium 139, potassium 3.8, creatinine of 1.2, and BUN of 25. His TSH 13.2 in 03/17/2025, up from 6.38 in 02/04/2012. His last BNP 1126, which is stable for him.     In summary, Mr. Tedesco is a 70-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with controlled hypertension and mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. His home blood pressure recording findings are explained by his frequent premature atrial contractions on EKG today, as his peripheral pulse is diminished with a short coupling interval between his sinus and atrial beats.    As he is asymptomatic and given his overall clinical picture, we would favor a trial of decreasing his carvedilol to 6.25 mg twice daily and continued observation, especially in light of his trifascicular block on ECG.     We counseled him that were he to develop symptoms of lightheadedness or presyncope, that further investigation for more significant bradyarrhythmia could be undertaken. We note that given his renal cell carcinoma,  antiplatelets and anticoagulation for primary prevention purposes are likely to lead to more bleeding risk and questionable benefit in Mr. Tedesco and thus we would favor avoiding these agents. We anticipate seeing him again in approximately 6 months with EKG and echocardiogram prior. We have asked him to discuss his recurrent nasal discharge with our colleagues in otolaryngology, who may have more definitive diagnostic and treatment modalities at their disposal.     We appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in his care. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, discontinued it 10/04/2012 due to hospitalization for acute renal failure and c. Diff colitis, and is here for follow-up.    LCV:  10/12/2012    Oncology History: The patient is a 70 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Sandler Rein 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by clear cell carcinoma (PAX2+, PAX8+, CK+), likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He  had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Oday Adame/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.  Since 03/17/2025,2012 takes 2 weeks on and 1 week off.  07/04/2012: pacemaker placed    10/05/2012 sutent discontinued due to hospitalization for ARF and c diff colitis    10/22/2012 new liver lesion on PET/CT    Interval History:  Mr. Schock completed flagyl 500 TID 1 week ago.  All his diarrhea had resolved on flagyl, but 1 day after stopping, his diarrhea returned: now having 4-5 episodes daily (no blood or melena).  He has not had fevers, nor any abdominal pain.  He doesn't get dizzy when standing up, and thinks he's keeping up on his fluids adequately.  He does get tired, especially going up stairs, and feels that his leg muscles are weak.  He had stopped HCTZ, and now notices more swelling in his legs.  He has been off sutent since 10/05/2012, and noticed that the rash on his upper arms is much better, and the purpura on his lower arms have faded considerably, now remaining only on the backs of his hands. Lastly, he has started to note mild diplopia, which was a symptom he had that led to the diagnosis of his brain lesions.

No MR evidence of   new metastatic lesions on this limited study.    2. Without contrast, we cannot assess for tiny enhancing metastatic   foci (new or previously seen). However, no new large foci of brain   edema are noted.    3. Unchanged mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses   likely representing an inflammatory/reactive process. Evolving right   nasopharyngeal mucous retention cyst.    10/22/2012 PET/CT:   IMPRESSION:    1. NEW HYPERMETABOLIC HYPODENSE LESION IN THE RIGHT HEPATIC LOBE IS   CONCERNING FOR NEW METASTASIS. RECOMMENDED DIAGNOSTIC LIVER CT FOR   FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION.    2. STABLE TWO SUBCENTIMETER NON-FDG AVID NODULES IN THE LEFT LOWER   LOBE AND DEVELOPMENT OF FEW NEW RIGHT UPPER LOBE PUNCTATE NODULES. IN   ADDITION, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED NUMBER OF NODULAR  OPACITIES AT THE   RIGHT LUNG BASE SOME OF WHICH HAVE MILD ACTIVITY AND APPEAR TO BE   INFECTIOUS/INFLAMMATORY.     3. STABLE LYTIC LESION IN THE LEFT FEMORAL NECK WITH MILD FDG   ACTIVITY IS LIKELY RELATED TO POST-RADIATION CHANGES.    4. FOCAL INCREASED FDG ACTIVITY OVERLYING THE LEFT LONGISSIMUS   CAPITIS MUSCLE IS LIKELY PHYSIOLOGIC BUT GIVEN THE PATIENTS HISTORY   RECOMMEND ATTENTION ON FOLLOW-UP TO EXCLUDE MALIGNANCY.     Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastasis in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. 08/29/2012 MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Meraz for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma. His metastatic RCC has now progressed in liver, and we will start pazopanib as soon as his diarrhea is well controlled.     1) c diff recurrence: discussed with ID fellow: since this is first recurrence and WBC <15, and creatinine not worsening, retreat with flagyl 500 TID X 14 days.  If recurs again, switch to oral vancomycin: full dose would be 125mg PO QID X14 d (will need to check with pharmacy about dose adjustment based on current Cr), then taper.   May also use immodium PRN.     2) RCC treatment: prescription given for Pazopanib- pt will call us when his diarrhea has resolved, before he takes his first pazopanib.     3)  neuro:  He has had intermittant diplopia since treatment: 9/12 MRI did not show any recurrence, and 11/2 PETCT did not show any gross recurrence (PET/CT is not a sensitive test for brain mets).  Will have low threshold to recheck another MRI if      4) edema:  recommend restart HCTZ.    5) periodonal infection: take ampiclliin as prescribed.     5) rash: was atypical for sutent side effect, but is much better now off sutent and will f/u with derm    6) Regarding his bradycardia and PPM: follow-up in cardiology.    Return for next oncology visit in 5 weeks.     Teaching Physician Attestation  I was present and directly participated during the history and physical examination with  the resident/fellow.

Since he was last here, he has continued on his sunitinib therapy 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off and finished his most recent cycle on Sunday and is due to restart the next one 11 days from now. He made the medication adjustments we recommended last time, including starting the carvedilol for which he is now on 6.25 mg b.i.d. and increasing his lisinopril to 40 mg per day, and he remains on the amlodipine 10 mg a day as well. His home blood pressures (including when he was on the sunitinib) have mostly been in the 130s/high 70s. He denies chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or dizziness.     He did have an episode on this last Sunday when he developed a painful red swollen first toe on his right foot. He said that this remained bad for the next couple of days, although in the last 24 hours, it has somewhat improved, although is still somewhat tender. He said he wondered if it could be gout, though he has not had a history of gout or having this happen to him in the past.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented on the EPIC documentation below. Of note, on my manual recheck of his blood pressure, it was 142/84.     Mr. Lombera had an echocardiogram performed today. The final read is pending, but my review of it shows normal LV systolic function. Comparing it side by side to his 05/01/2025 echo, his LV systolic function appears to be improved (as it has been noted to be 45% at the time. Again, the final read is pending.     Overall, I am delighted that Mr. Mann ejection fraction appears to have improved. His blood pressure control sounds better at home based on his home blood pressure  readings. It is slightly higher than I would ideally like to see it today, particularly given that he is off the sunitinib, but given that his home readings are lower, I am asked him to continue to monitor it at home and if they start rising significantly above the low 140s systolic, asked him to call us and we would either increase his carvedilol or add a medication such as hydralazine.     Regarding his toe pain, the location is certainly classic for gout. He does not have any obvious gout risk factors. He is not on any diuretic therapy which could have set off an attack as well. As he is seeing Dr. Baez tomorrow, I want her to see it before empirically treating it as gout in case she is concerned it could be related to his cancer therapy (though it certainly does not look like the hand/foot syndrome that could be seen with sunitinib). I also added a uric acid level onto tomorrow's labs, which, while not by any means diagnostic, particularly in the setting of an acute flare, if it is very high, it would be more suggestive of gout and if it is frankly normal, it would be less suggestive. If he is still having symptoms and Dr. Coats does not think it is related to the cancer or cancer therapy, I think it would be reasonable to treat him with colchicine for the flare.     I will plan to see him again in 6 months' time with an echo or sooner as is clinically indicated.     Thank you for allowing me to take part in the care of Mr. Lombera Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.     ADDENDUM: The final read on the echo did not report a significant improvement from prior, but on my direct visualization I believe there is an improvement and the LV systolic function is at worst minimally reduced from normal.

You, of course, are very familiar with his medical history, but please allow me to recount the same for our own record keeping purposes.     As you know, Mr. Cloutier Pulu  generally healthy until approximately 11/04/2010, when he first  manifested symptoms of hypertension. Was started on amlodipine and lisinopril therapy. He, unfortunately, developed diplopia, as well as fatigue, weight loss, and a general sense of malaise in February of this year, at which point a CT scan had demonstrated several intraparenchymal masses, as well as 2 cm sphenoid sinus mass. He ultimately underwent a clivus biopsy on 02/04/2025 which had demonstrated findings consistent with possible renal primary and started XRT nasopharynx and brain and underwent 5 subsequent cycles. He also underwent CyberKnife therapy in early March. He began sunitinib therapy on 02/22/2025 and has continued on this to date. He is currently on 4-week on, 2-week off cycle, and is on the second cycle at present. He notes a relatively marked decline in his energy level since starting sunitinib therapy but has not noted any dyspnea on exertion, chest pressure, shortness of breath at rest, orthopnea, PND or palpitations. He, however, is notably less than active than he was prior. He states for example that he completed a 150 mile bike trip in Europe in October of last year, prior to the development of his renal cell carcinoma. Prior to that trip, he did have symptoms which were found to be heartburn, for which he received a stress echocardiogram. We have the report with us today, which demonstrates no evidence of stress-induced wall motion abnormalities.       Mr. Cloutier underwent routine echocardiography on 05/01/2011, which had demonstrated a mild decrement in left ventricular systolic function with no other significant abnormalities. EF quantified by MOD was approximately 45% on that examination. Notably, the echocardiogram images were relatively poor.     He was subsequently referred to us for evaluation of possible tyrosine kinase associated left ventricular systolic dysfunction and evaluation and management for the  same.     Review of Systems: A 14-point review of systems was negative except as noted above.     Medical History:    1.  Hypertension.    2.  Renal cell carcinoma with metastases involving the brain, neck, proximal humerus, and skull base.     Current Medications:    1.  Sunitinib 50 mg daily    2.  Amlodipine 10 mg a day.    3.  Lisinopril 20 mg a day.    4.  Cosopt.    5.  Pantoprazole.    6.  Nystatin.    7.  Zoledronic acid once monthly.    8.  Travoprost.     Allergies: The patient has no known drug allergies.     Family History: The patient's mother had renal cell carcinoma. Father had prostate carcinoma. Sister has breast cancer. There is no history of premature cardiovascular disease in the family.     Social History: The patient currently lives Visalia with his wife and has several children and grandchildren who live in the Pacific Northwest. He is a former pipe smoker for approximately 1 year. Never smoked cigarettes or cigars. He has mild to moderate routine alcohol with approximately 2 drinks per night.     Physical Examination: Blood pressure today was 140/90, rechecked 130/88 manually, respirations 16, pulse 65, 191 pounds, height 5-foot-9, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. General: Well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. HEENT: Extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx was clear. Neck: No jugular venous distention is apparent on my exam. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs are appreciated. The patient is warm peripherally. Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. Extremities: Warm and well perfused. No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Abdomen: No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly on my exam.     Relevant laboratory testing: The patient has a creatinine as of early May of 1.1, potassium 4, sodium 138, hemoglobin of 13, BNP of 290, troponin I is undetectable, and free T4 of 1.1 with a TSH of 4.49. Cardiovascular  Investigations: The patient had an EKG performed today which demonstrates sinus rhythm with normal axis and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a QRS duration of 124 msec. Other intervals are unremarkable. No ST or T wave changes noted. Transthoracic echocardiogram performed on 05/01/2025 demonstrates normal left ventricular systolic size with mildly diminished left ventricular systolic ejection fraction of approximately 45%. Mild TR and MR appreciated. RVSP estimated was approximately 42 with a right atrial pressure of 15 estimated on this exam.     Impression and Plan: Mr. Cloutier is a 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and recent diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with multiple metastatic lesions. He has currently had a relatively encouraging treatment response on sunitinib therapy as an adjunct to local radiation and CyberKnife treatment. We understand that he is to undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy to be performed sometime in the next few weeks. His current LV systolic dysfunction is almost certainly due to tyrosine kinase inhibition given that he has normal stress echocardiograms, and he has had no interval change in symptoms between that an the initiation of his therapy. His systolic dysfunction, however, is admittedly quite mild, and we would attempt to medically manage him just prior to discontinuing sunitinib therapy, given his dramatic response to the same. Therefore, we have initiated carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily and increased his lisinopril to 40 mg daily for improved neurohormonal blockade and afterload reduction, respectively. He will have labs performed in approximately 1 week, and these will be faxed to our office. Any adjustments that are necessary will be performed at that time.     We will, thus, see Mr. Cloutier Manalang in our clinic in approximately 3 weeks with echocardiogram to be performed at that time to reevaluate left ventricular systolic function. Please do not  hesitate to contact us with any further questions. Thank you for your kind referral and the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.    He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up and Zometa today.    Oncology History: This is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Ecklund Cornish 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an  FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011:  XRT to  left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Sambrano Weintraub/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT    02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.    02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily. Completes his 2nd, 4 week course on 05/03/2025.    04/23/2011: A skull base MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.    07/04/2011: A skull base MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.      Review of Systems: Feeling well overall and tolerating sutent. His last day of this cycle was Friday (07/25/2011). No further diplopia. He has noticed hearing loss, which he relates previously improved after receiving antibiotics. No recent fever, chills, sinus tenderness, headaches, or nasal discharge. Some moderate fatigue, but he is playing golf occasionally. He has noticed easy cuts/bruising on his forearms. Mild diarrhea. Weight stable, no chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or chills.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 69 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the femur in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. No further diplopia. His hearing loss is of concern and for this he will be referred to an ENT here at Stanford.  He will continue to be followed by Dr. Biggs with a brain MRI in October.  The plan is for him to continue his 2 rest weeks and restart sutent for 4 weeks. He will receive zometa today and every 6 weeks. He will return in 6 weeks for Frahm, MD, zometa. In the interim, we will discuss the possibility of nephrectomy with the urologic oncology surgeons as he has responded well to sutent.    HTN: Seen by Dr. Daugherty Black 06/18/2011 at which time coreg was started. His echo from 06/18/2011 showed an EF of 47% (stable from prior). He will follow up with Dr. Hauge as scheduled and will continue to monitor home BPs.    The patient and his wife agree to and understand the above plan. They know to call in the interim with questions or concerns. RTC in 6 weeks for Siva, MD, and zometa.

He is a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed likely renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the skull base and brain.     History of Present Illness: On 01/28/2011, he had sudden onset of diplopia and saw an ophthalmologist who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was seen by you on 02/03/2011, and you ordered an MRI on the same day of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by  carcinoma, likely renal primary. On 02/06/2011, the case was discussed at head and neck tumor board with the recommendation for patient to be evaluated by neuro radiation oncology, and urology medical oncology, who he has not seen yet. He has a PET CT scheduled later today and CT CAP tomorrow. He is here today to discuss the role of radiosurgery. Subjectively, he continues to have diplopia, and uses a left eye patch, left eye achiness, intermittent slight nasal stuffiness, and  denies headaches or other neurological symptoms.     Allergies: No known drug allergies.    Medications: Cosopt OP, Xalatan drops, Norvasc.    Past Medical/Surgical History: Glaucoma, hypertension, hernia, tonsillectomy.     Social History: He lives with his wife in Visalia, denies smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally.     Family History: Mother-renal cancer. Father-prostate cancer.     Review of Systems: As noted in the HPI. The rest of the 14-point system review is negative.    Physical Examination: General: A pleasant man in no acute distress. KPS 80. Vital Signs: BP 170/80, P 87, height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 87.8 kg. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. PERRL, sluggish on the left. Diplopia in all gazes.  Left eye patch. Left 6th nerve palsy. Left eye slight deviation. Oropharynx clear. Neck: Supple. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Bowel sounds present. Soft, nontender. No organomegaly. Extremities: Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin: Warm and dry. Neurologic: Alert and oriented, with fluent speech. Cranial nerves 2-12 intact, except for left 6th nerve palsy. Sensation intact to light touch. Visual fields full to confrontation. Motor strength 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. DTRs 2+ throughout. Gait, Steady. Tandem walk, intact.    Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the orbits, face and neck of 02/03/2011, which showed an enhancing mass involving the midline nasopharynx, right fossa of Rossenmuller, clival extension, sphenoid sinus and medial cavernous sinus bilaterally. There are enhancing intraparenchymal brain lesions, left parietal (series 16, image 13), left frontal (series 16, image 18), right frontal (series 16, image 8).     Laboratories: Outside Creatinine on 01/29/2011, 0.9 mg/dL.    Summary: Bud Stroh is a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed likely renal cell carcinoma  metastatic to the skull base and brain, here to discuss radiosurgery. He anticipates urology medical oncology appointment and has a PET CT later today. We discussed with the patient and wife that the clival nasopharyngeal and intraparynchemal brain lesions are likely metastases from renal cell cancer. We explained to them that in general systemic treatment does not cross the blood brain barrier and treatment options include whole brain irradiation including the nasopharynx, 4-5 weeks of external beam radiotherapy; or stereotactic radiosurgery to the nasopharynx and the intraparenchymal brain metastases. We discussed with them that renal cell carcinoma is historically radio-resistant and for this reason we favor stereotactic radiosurgery, and defer side effects of whole brain irradiation. In addition, treatment with radiosurgery now would make it easier to plan for whole brain irradiation should he need this in the future. The rationale, benefits, logistics, and risks including, but not limited to, radiation edema, esophagitis, epistaxis, or nasal dryness. All questions were answered to their satisfaction and informed consent was obtained. We recommend follow up brain MRIs every 3 months after Cyberknife treatment.     A stereotactic MRI will be obtained and he was given Dexamethasone prescription to see if this helps with the diplopia. We will follow up with urology medical oncology regarding an appointment in hopes that he can be seen prior to Cyberknife treatment.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the medical care of Mr. Stroh Should there be further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.     Sincerely,    Christine Vuppala Lovell, NP    Iris Derosa Prager, MD  _________________    I performed a separate history and physical exam, as well as discussion of the assessment and plan with the patient.  I reviewed the note above and agree with the documented findings, assessment and plan, with the addition  of the items documented below:    History:  Bud Stroh is a 69 Y man with nasopharyngeal and parenchymal brain metastases of renal cell cancer who is still undergoing staging work-up.  He was previously healthy until a few weeks ago.  Aside from diplopia remains otherwise asymptomatic.  Physical Exam:  General: Well appearing. KPS 90.  HEENT: NA/AT, EOMI with the exception of restricted left lateral gaze consistent with a left 6th nerve palsy.  Nares is normal with ho idendifiable obstructign mass and without epistaxis. Neck supple without adenopathy.  Lungs clear topercussion. Abdomen :  nontender  Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact with the exception of left 6th nerve palsy. Normal tandem and casual gait.     Imaging: Independently reviewed as above.    Impression and plan:   69 Y man with nasopharyngeal and parenchymal brain metastases of renal cell cancer who is still undergoing staging work-up.  I discussed the treatment options with the patient, including no treatment, surgery, external beam irradiation and radiosurgery.  We plan to treat the brain metastases and nasopharyngeal/clival metastasis with Cyberknife SRS.  Each brain metastasis will be treated to 24 gy in a single fraction while the treatment to the nasopharyngeal/clival metastasis will be fractionated to approximately 27.5-30 Gy in 5 session(s).

On 01/28/2011, he had the sudden onset of diplopia and saw an ophthalmologist who treats his glaucoma who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was seen by on 02/03/2011.  An MRI on the same day of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes.     DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the beginning of the setup and treatment.      On 02/14/2011, the patient underwent the fabrication of the Aquaplast mask followed by a thin-section CT scan. This was accompanied by a thin-section MRI using T1 weighted sequence and contrast.      All studies were carefully reviewed for completeness and for adequacy for fusion and planning using the CyberKnife system.  The findings on these studies were then correlated closely with what was seen on prior  diagnostic images. The images from the stereotactic CT and MR scans were then sent by network, from the scanners, to the CyberKnife Multiplan treatment-planning work station.     On the CyberKnife treatment planning work station the stereotactic CT and MR scans were fused with one another. We then used standard drawing tools to delineate the treatment margins.     The target volume and dimensions are listed below. Adjacent critical anatomy was also delineated. In an iterative fashion a treatment plan was developed for this lesion. Once a satisfactory plan was developed, sign-off was obtained from both Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology.

He is a 71-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma who was treated with CyberKnife 2 years ago for a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, and left frontal, left parietal and right temporal metastases. At the time of his last followup visit on 03/08/2013, imaging showed interval development of at least 28 new enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, and increased enhancement of the previously treated clival lesion. Mr. Lima received whole-brain radiation therapy at Sequoia Regional Cancer Center, completed on 04/05/2025. He has noted left arm tingling for the last few months, and increasing left arm weakness for the last month. The arm weakness became much more pronounced last week. He can no longer lift the left arm, but maintains grip strength.   He continues dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily, which was recently decreased from 4 mg 3 times daily.  While on dexamethasone, he has developed bilateral lower extremity weakness with difficulty climbing stairs, and significant edema. Mr. Lima further reports ear fullness and difficulty hearing since completion of whole brain radiation therapy, and an increase in his longstanding double vision this morning. He denies additional neurologic complaints. A head CT was obtained last weekend, reportedly showing no acute changes. A brain MRI was repeated at Stanford Hospital today, formal report pending.     He continues systemic management with everolimus and is scheduled for followup in the medical oncology clinic this Thursday.     Allergies: NKDA.     Medications: Cosopt, Epogen, folic acid, allopurinol, aspirin, Coreg, everolimus, hydralazine, Imdur, Xalatan ophthalmic drops, Synthroid, Mycostatin.     Physical Examination: He is a pleasant man with a cushingoid appearance in no acute distress. KPS 60. Temperature 36.2, respirations 17, pulse 80, blood pressure 171/91. HEENT: Normocephalic, alopecic, extraocular movements intact. Oropharynx clear. He is hard of hearing. Neck: Supple. Breathing unlabored. Extremities: Left hand with edema, skin discoloration, and a scab in the region of the 5th metacarpal. Bilateral pitting lower extremity edema extending to the thigh. Neurologic Examination: He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Cranial nerve examination II-XII intact. Motor strength 3/5 left deltoid, 4/5 left biceps and triceps, 5/5 left wrist, grip and finger extension. Bilateral hip flexors 4/5. Strength otherwise 5/5 bilaterally. Sensation decreased to light touch left upper extremity. He has difficulty arising from a seated to standing position. Gait steady.     Laboratory Data: 04/06/2013: WBC 14.1, RBC 4.11, hemoglobin 11.2, hematocrit 36.3, albumin 3.3, sodium 143, potassium 5.2, creatinine 1.3, BUN 79.     Imaging: We personally reviewed the MRI of the brain which was completed earlier today. When  compared to prior imaging from 03/07/2013, there has been interval decrease in edema with stable size of numerous intraparenchymal metastases.   No new metastases are identified.     Summary: Demetrios Lima is a 71-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the brain and skull base, who was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery 2 years ago and whole brain radiation therapy last week, and now presents with increasing left upper extremity weakness. A brain MRI was repeated earlier today, which did not explain the increasing arm weakness. On the MRI, vasogenic edema was improved, no new metastases were identified, and the previously seen metastases were stable. He will be sent for a cervical spine MRI today.     It is unclear if the steroids are exacerbating the left upper extremity weakness, and a slow Decadron taper will be initiated. We also recommend that he present to the Stanford ED for further evaluation of the left hand wound. He will try decongestants to help with the ear fullness and hearing loss post WBRT. We will follow up with Mr. Lima after the C-spine MRI.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Demetrios Lima. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.     Sincerely,     Laurie Stowers Iwamoto, NP     Iris Oza Dufour, MD   Associate Professor   Radiation Oncology   _______   I, Iris Findley Borrero, MD, saw and examined the patient and participated in all aspects of this patient's evaluation and management, including history, physical exam, review of laboratory studies, and discussion of findings and plan with the family. I have reviewed the above note, have edited it where needed, and agree with the assessment and plan.     Attending Narrative: 71 yr old man with brain metastases of renal cell cancer. He was treated with Cyberknife 2 years ago,but earlier this year developed more diffuse brain metastases and was referred for whole brain irradiation. This course was  completed a last week. Currently he has a new issue of nearly flaccid dysfunction of the left upper extremity.   Today's MRI does not show progression of the brain lesions. However, it appears that he has recurrent infection of the left hand. We will send him to the ED for further evaluation. Perhaps a c-spine MRI may help clarify if there are other sources to explain the new clinical findings.

At his last visit on 09/08/2012, he had a new pruritic rash on his forearms bilaterally which has thought to be a photo drug eruption due to a recent increase in his HCTZ dose. He was started on lidex-E which he applied to his arms daily. Today he reports resolution of this rash. Of note, he was hospitalized for dehydration due to C. difficile a month ago and has been off the HCTZ since then. At his last visit, he also had new purpura on his shoulders and back, thought to be due to a chemotherapy drug reaction. He reports that his lesions completely resolved when he was hospitalized and taken off his chemotherapeutic agent, Sutent and treated for C. Difficile. Today he has no skin complaints. He reports that his doctors are going to restart his HCTZ and a different chemotherapeutic agent, pazopanib in the near future.

Rhinosinusitis is a condition where the mucous membranes in the nose and sinuses become infected, swollen, and blocked. The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the bones of the face and head. They are located between the eyes, behind the forehead, and in the cheeks. The sinuses drain mucus through small openings that are connected to the inside of the nose. They play an important role in how we breathe and make mucous secretions.    During your surgery, an endoscope and other small tools will be passed through your nostrils. An endoscope is a metal tube with a light and tiny video camera on the end. This allows your caregiver to remove small amounts of bone or other materials blocking the sinus openings. These openings where sinuses naturally drain are used to insert the endoscope without destroying important mucous membrane lining. Your caregiver may also do stereotaxy, where scanned images of your head will show pictures in three-dimensional (3-D) views. This will help him clearly see the nasal passages and sinuses while watching the images in a monitor. Stereotaxy will enable your caregiver to find the sinuses with blockages and other problems more accurately. With FESS, symptoms of rhinosinusitis may be relieved and your quality of life improved.  AFTER YOU LEAVE:  Your medicines are:   \u00b7 Keep a written list of the medicines you take, the amounts, and when and why you take them. Bring the list of your medicines or the pill bottles when you see your caregivers. Learn why you take each medicine. Ask your caregiver for information about your medicine. Do not use any medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbs, or food supplements without first talking to caregivers.    Always take your medicine as directed by caregivers. Call  your caregiver if you think your medicines are not helping or if you feel you are having side effects. Do not quit taking your medicines until you discuss it with your caregiver. If you are taking medicine that makes you drowsy, do not drive or use heavy equipment.  Antibiotics: This medicine is given to fight or prevent an infection caused by bacteria. Always take your antibiotics exactly as ordered by your caregiver. Keep taking this medicine until it is completely gone, even if you feel better. Stopping antibiotics without your caregiver's OK may make the medicine unable to kill all of the germs. Never \"save\" antibiotics or take leftover antibiotics that were given to you for another illness.     Pain medicine: You may be given medicine to take at home to take away or decrease pain. Your caregiver will tell you how much to take and how often to take it. Take the medicine exactly as directed by your caregiver. Do not wait until the pain is too bad before taking your medicine. The medicine may not work as well at controlling your pain if you wait too long to take it. Tell caregivers if the pain medicine does not help, or if your pain comes back too soon.     Your caregiver may slowly decrease the amount of steroid medicine you are using. Do not change the amount or stop using this medicine until your caregiver tells you to.  Follow-up visit information: Keep all appointments. Write down any questions you may have. This way you will remember to ask these questions during your next visit.  Home care:   \u00b7 Avoid blowing your nose too hard. If you cannot avoid blowing your nose, do it gently or use a soft rubber suction bulb.    Drink lots of liquids. These include water, fruit juices, milk, or energy drinks. Limit the amount of caffeine you drink, such as coffee, tea, and soda. Ask your caregiver if you must limit the amount of liquid you drink.    Rinse your nose with salt water. Washing your nose may help your thick  mucous come out with blowing. Ask your caregiver for more information on how to prepare and do nasal washings.    Use a cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier. This adds moisture to the air and helps thin the nasal discharge. This can also help keep you from getting colds. Wash the humidifier each day with soap and warm water to keep it free of germs.    Wash hands frequently. Wash your hands especially after coming into contact with a person who has a cold. This will help prevent the spread of germs. Germ-killing hand lotion or gel may be used to clean your hands when there is no water available.   Nasal packing: Ask your caregiver how long the nasal packings will stay inside your nose. If these are to be removed and replaced at home, ask your caregiver how to properly do them.  Quit smoking: It is never too late to quit smoking. Smoking harms the heart, lungs, and the blood. You are more likely to have a heart attack, lung disease, and cancer if you smoke. You will help yourself and those around you by not smoking. Ask your caregiver for more information about how to stop smoking if you are having trouble quitting.   Other special instructions:   \u00b7 Driving:     Exercising:     Lifting and moving objects:     Returning to work or school:   CALL IF:  \u00b7 You have a temperature over     You have bruises or swelling around your nose or eyes.    You have chills, a cough, or feel weak and achy.    You have nausea (upset stomach) or vomiting (throwing up).    Your nasal packing becomes soaked with blood.    Your skin is itchy, swollen, or has a rash.    You have questions or concerns about your surgery, condition, or care.  SEEK CARE IMMEDIATELY IF:  \u00b7 You have a fever, stiff neck, or an eye pain especially when looking directly at the lights.    You have a severe headache that does not go away even after taking pain medicines.    You have clear fluid coming from your nose.    You have pus or a foul-smelling odor coming from  your nose.    You have trouble breathing, seeing, talking, or thinking clearly.    Your face is getting numb.    Your symptoms come back or become worse.     \u00a9 1974-2008 Thomson MICROMEDEX. All rights reserved.            General Anesthesia or Sedation  Patient Discharge Education  All patients must have someone drive them home after surgery. For the first 24 hours after surgery, we recommend that you do not make critical decisions, sign important papers, drive, operate machinery, or do anything that requires you to be alert.  Have a responsible, adult friend or family member stay with you the first night after your surgery. You will need assistance while the effects of your anesthetic or sedation is wearing off.  Eat lightly for the first 24 hours. Some people feel nauseated after surgery, often due to medication, dehydration, or from the stress of surgery. Try to eat easily-digested foods (i.e., soup, crackers, tea, toast, carbonated drinks, Jell-O, broths). Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid spicy or greasy foods.  Take your pain medication as directed. Do not take medication more often than prescribed (overdosage is dangerous).  Your pain medication allows you to be up and around more comfortably, which expedites healing, stimulates circulation, and helps prevent post-operative complications.  DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL OR TAKE ANY DEPRESSANTS OR PAIN MEDICATIONS other than those prescribed by your doctor. The combination could cause dizziness, nausea, etc.  Do not drive within 24 hours of taking narcotic pain medications.  There may be side effects from your prescribed medication. To alleviate some of the side effects, suggestions include:  For constipation: Increase your fluid and fiber intake.  For stomach irritation, itching/hives: Call your physician so that a different pain medication can be prescribed.  For persistent pain despite taking medication: Call your doctor. The prescribed medication may not be strong  enough.  If you do not urinate within 8 to 12 hours after surgery or if you feel pressure to urinate but cannot, call your surgeon or go to the nearest Emergency Room.  You may tend to be sleepy the first 24 hours. You should rest and take it easy your first day home.    Please follow your doctor\u00bfs home care instructions for your particular surgery.    Follow-Up Care and Appointment  You should have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your doctor. If you do not, call to schedule to be seen by your doctor.  If you have any questions or problems after your surgery/procedure, contact your physician at telephone number _________________________________ or the 24-hour page operator at (650) 723-6661 for Stanford Hospital Faculty Physicians.

He has metastatic renal cell CA to the skull base and has had cyberknife and is on chronic oral chemo.  He has hearing difficulty, and wants to consider PE tubes.    Exam:  EACs clear bilaterally  B TMs intact  There are serous effusions bilaterally.  Remainder of H&N exam wnl.    Audio: bilateral mixed loss, primarily conductive. Type b tymps.  MRI reviewed: large skull base mass, predominantly right sided, with bone erosion/post treatment changes.  No obvious encephalocele, but I can not r/o that the effusions are CSF.    Imp: bilateral MEE.    Plan: I recommend conservative management with hearing aids first.   The risk of placing PETs is that he is likely to have chronic otorrhea that does not stop even if the PETs are removed.  Also, there is a risk of CSF otorrhea.    He will try HA's locally, and I will add a CT temporal bones on to his upcoming CT body to assess for bony dehiscences.  He will call for results and if he wishes to proceed with PETs.

As you recall, Mr. Advincula is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma status post CyberKnife radiosurgery on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2011 to 4 metastatic brain lesions in the following regions: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus, left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal. Additionally, a left femoral neck metastases was treated with 20 Gy conventional radiotherapy 02/19/2025 through 8, 2011. Followup imaging 04/23/2011, demonstrated stability of all treated lesions with no new metastases. He is maintained on Sutent, and interval extracranial imaging has not been performed. Today he returns for a 4-month  follow-up visit, as well as discussion of the results of his most recent MRI.     Symptomatically, Mr. Advincula Brunelle near full resolution of diplopia within 2 months of radiosurgical treatment. However, within the last month and a half, he has noted 2-3 separate episodes of diplopia, which occurred after bending over, and resolved within 1 hour. Additionally, he developed decreased hearing loss bilaterally 6 weeks ago. The hearing loss improved shortly after receiving antibiotics for a sinus infection, though again recurred. The hearing on the right is currently worse than the left after the use of over-the-counter ear wax removal medication in the right ear within the last 2 days. He denies additional neurologic complaints. He has no complaints of headaches, seizures, speech or memory difficulties. The remainder of the 14-point review of systems is negative.     Physical Examination: He is 85 kg, blood pressure 143/84, pulse 79, temperature 36.5. He is a well-appearing man in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, sclera anicteric. Left ear is clear with intact tympanic membrane. Right ear with cerumen covering part of his tympanic membrane. Speech is clear. Thought process coherent. Mentation: He is alert and oriented x3. Cranial nerves 2-12 are intact to detailed testing. Gait is narrow based and steady. Strength is 5/5 upper and lower extremities. Sensation is intact and symmetric in both upper and lower extremities. Romberg is negative.     I personally reviewed the MRI of the skull base completed earlier today which was compared to prior imaging at the time of treatment dated 02/13/2011. This shows the treated tumor within the nasopharynx/sphenoid sinus has improved, with interval decrease by approximately 50%. The previous enhancing portion within the sphenoid sinus is now dissipating. The posterior nasopharynx and mucosa remain stable. The treated intraparenchymal metastases within the  left frontal lobe (series 14 image 19) left parietal lobe (series 14 image 15), and right temporal lobe (series 14 image 9) have significantly decreased in size with only a small focal area of enhancement remaining. No new metastases are visualized.     Mckay Advincula is a 69-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He remains radiographically stable 4 months after CyberKnife treatment of a nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastases and left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal intraparenchymal metastases. No new metastatic lesions are visualized and I am pleased with his progress to date as he continues to remain radiographically and clinically stable. His diplopia is most likely related to ongoing irritation of the nerves by residual tumor as current imaging studies showed no evidence of recurrence. I recommend a repeat stereotactic MRI of the skull base and orbit and clinic visit in 3 months. In the interim, he will obtain an audiogram for evaluation of the bilateral hearing loss. The audiogram will be coordinated with his next Stanford Medical Oncology appointment scheduled on 07/31/2025. He is also encouraged to contact us sooner should he develop problems before that time.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of Mckay Advincula. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

He checked his BP on 06/22/2025 and it was 141/82... his pulse rate was 41. Today, 06/24/2025, we checked his BP and it was significantly higher 165/111 but his pulse rate is 34.  Much too low.  We started the new dosage of Thyroid medication.  Could this need to be adjusted???              He has almost no appetite... food seems to make him nauseated.  He has eaten some fruit and I'm giving him some Ensure .              I'm quite worried because this is not normal...he is so weak and pale! ( and the pulse level is very low).

When I saw him last, he was feeling very poorly and labs after the visit revealed significant hypercalcemia. He was therefore admitted for treatment of symptomatic hypercalcemia and symptomatically significantly improved with this therapy. He was discharged on  pazopanib, which he was taking for what I believe to be a week or two and was then admitted locally at Kaweah Delta Hospital in early January with severe dyspnea and hypoxia and was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure. I do see a note that his saturation was 80% in the emergency room and he was quite hypertensive with blood pressures in the 170s. His pazopanib was stopped and he has been off it since then, and I believe he was diuresed in the hospital and then was discharged and now has been on Bumex 1 mg b.i.d. His thyroid supplementation appears to have been inadvertently stopped, I believe after his Stanford hospitalization and I asked him to restart that today.     He says that since his hospitalization at Kaweah Delta, he actually feels as well as he has for quite some time. His breathing is overall better and his energy is better, though he still remains fatigued overall. Home blood pressures have mainly been in the low 140s over low 80s.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented in the Epic documentation below. Comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     We did an interrogation of his Medtronic pacemaker. He is 47% atrially sensed and 84% ventricularly paced, usually in complete heart block. He has a lower rate of 60 and upper tracking rate of 130. He has had no significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias since I last saw him.       Labs from today include a white count of 5.3, hemoglobin 9.5, platelets of 301,000. Sodium 143, potassium 4.8, BUN and creatinine of 41 and 1.5 respectively. His LFTs show an albumin which has improved up to 2.5 from 1.7 in December. His calcium today is 9.0 and his TSH is elevated at 22.5 but again, he has been inadvertently off his Synthroid.     Overall, Mr. Welch remains quite tenuous. He has a significant cardiomyopathy, which on his echo when he was last here showed an EF of 29%. The  echo report from Kaweah Delta reports an EF that in the summary notes an EF of 45% but in the calculations looks more like 35 so it is hard to know if this is a real improvement or not. Certainly, his cardiomyopathy could be related to his tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but the difficulty is he has clearly had progressive cancer as well, so our biggest goal is to try to treat his heart failure to allow him to receive the cancer therapy he needs. He continues to have evidence of right-sided pleural effusion, which I suspect is malignant, particularly given that there was some possible evidence of pleural nodularity on his last imaging but the effusion appears stable and his breathing is stable today. He is going to be seeing Dr. Stern tomorrow. I am starting him on hydralazine 25 mg t.i.d. and Imdur 30 mg daily. He is going to call us if he has weight gain or if his blood pressure is consistently above 140/90 and we will increase his antihypertensive regimen accordingly or adjust his diuretics accordingly. I will plan to see him back in clinic in approximately 1 months' time or sooner as is clinically indicated.     Thank you for allowing me to take part in Mr. Berber care. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up and Zometa today.    Oncology History: This is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Wade Fair 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG avid  soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Navarrette Wegner/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily.   10/19/2011: Completed most recent cycle of 4 weeks.      Review of Systems: Feeling well overall and tolerating sutent. His last day of this cycle was 10/19/2011.No further diplopia. After ENT consult at Stanford in early 10/04/2011 hearing aides were recommended; he is now wearing hearing aides and hearing is improved. No recent fever, chills, sinus tenderness, headaches, or nasal discharge. Some moderate fatigue, but he is playing golf occasionally. He has noticed easy cuts/bruising on his forearms. Mild diarrhea. Weight stable, no chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or chills.     Social History: Married, accompanied by his wife. Family will travel to Hawaii for Thanksgiving week.

Normal LV size with mild/moderately  reduced   systolic function. The estimated EF by MOD is 45%.   Suboptimal images. 2. Mild TR and MR. Raman estimated   RVSP is 42 mmHg (RAP=15). 3. No prior study available   for comparison.      Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 69 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the femur in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides which have improved his hearing. He continues to be followed by Dr. Hua next MRI and f/u with Dr. Atchison Topping 4 months.     The plan is for him to continue his 2 rest weeks and restart sutent for 4 weeks. He will receive zometa today and every 6 weeks.    10/21/2011 TSH elevated at 6.14, today levothyroxine increased to 75 mcg daily.  Sutent and Stanford Mouth Wash both refilled.     He will return in 6 weeks for Esau, MD, zometa. We did discuss the possibility of nephrectomy with the urologic oncology surgeons as he has responded well to sutent; however there are concerns regarding the brain and bone lesiopns which may not make him a great candidate for cytoreductive nephrectomy.     HTN: Seen by Dr. Stidham Spitzer 06/18/2011 at which time coreg was started. His echo from 06/18/2011 showed an EF of 47% (stable from prior). He will f/u with Dr. Fierro  and will continue to monitor home BPs. Next visit with Dr. Kawasaki 01/04/2012. ECHO same day    The patient and his wife agree to and understand the above plan. They know to call in the interim with questions or concerns.

The nasal valve areas were examined for abnormalities or collapse. The inferior and middle turbinates were evaluated. The middle and superior meastuses, and the sphenoethmoid recesses were examined and inspected for mucopurulence and polyps. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was returned to ambulatory status.   Findings:   Posterior septectomy.  Sphenoid with mucus coating residual tumor, debrided.  Significant regression of  tumor.  Also with purulent drainage from right ethmoids.  No CSF noted      Assessment/Plan:  69M with sphenoid/clival mass, renal cell metastasis.    -with active sinusitis drainage very unlikely to be CSF, will monitor closely and give cup for collection if problem worsens  -will treat with augmentin x 2 weeks with one refill  -if ear fullness does not resolve on antibiotics will send to otology for myringotomy tube  -RTC 2 weeks when they have other Stanford appointments.

As you know, he is a pleasant 70-year-old man with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction with conduction system disease. He has been on sunitinib therapy since 03/04/2011, and has had challenges blood pressure control on 4 antihypertensives. He has had mildly to mild moderately reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography and a recent hospitalization for bradycardia. He reports to us that in July he noted on consecutive days low pulse rate on his home blood pressure monitor, down to a rate of 35. He also had for the 1st time developed some lightheadedness on 06/23/2025. He called our colleagues at the Cancer Center, who recommended that he proceed to the local emergency room, which he did. There he was admitted and evaluated by his local electrophysiologist. It was decided to go forward with a dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which was and was successful with some difficulties with hematoma in the postoperative period. He did not require reexploration and had no signs of infection. He was implanted with a Medtronics SureScan MRI compatible dual-chamber pacemaker. This will greatly facilitate future examinations to evaluate progression  of his metastatic disease.     He again notes that he is having daily symptoms of serosanguineous drainage from his nose after awakening. He also complains of some exertional intolerance that has improved mildly since his pacemaker placement, but he is still on a gradual but slow decline in terms of over the past year. He states he has not played golf, which was his usual form of intentional exercise since his pacemaker placement, which is now greater than 6 weeks ago. He is planning on playing his 1st round of golf with his pacemaker this Sunday.     A complete 14-point review of systems was also notable for swelling in the bilateral ankles, as well as a severe sunburn on the bilateral forearms. He also notes new swelling over the past week of his left arm greater than right. This is the site of his new pacemaker generator.    Current Medications: Amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol is currently held, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg daily that he believes has recently increased, and 40 mg daily of lisinopril. He is also taking Protonix and sunitinib as directed.    Physical Exam: Today, blood pressure 144/73, pulse 67, respirations 16, weight 79 kg. Height 5 feet 9 inches, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. In general, he is an elderly appearing man in no acute distress. Appears stated age.  Oropharynx clear with moist mucous membranes. Jugular venous pressure not appreciably elevated. Thyroid is not palpably enlarged. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is regular rate and rhythm. There is a well-healed pacemaker pocket scar with 1 stitch and some granular material beneath it without tenderness or fluctuance. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatojugular reflux. There are positive bowel sounds. Extremities are warm, well perfused, with 2+ edema to the knee bilaterally in the lower extremities and nonpitting edema of  the left forearm. There is erythema and scaling on the bilateral forearms. He has no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically and psychiatrically he appears appropriate and intact with normal gait and range of motion of the left arm.    Recent Laboratory Testing: 07/28/2012, shows sodium of 139, potassium 4.6, BUN of 38 and a creatinine of 2.3, that is up from 2.0 in June, and 1.8 May this year. His albumin was also low at 2.5 and TSH elevated at 9.7.     The echocardiogram performed today showed a ventricular pacemaker activation with mild left ventricular enlargement and moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 41% with significant conduction and apical wall motion abnormalities, reflecting his pacemaker activation. Compared to the echocardiogram in 04/04/2012, his overall left ventricular function appears mildly decreased. The right ventricular systolic pressure is 38 mmHg, and estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg.     In summary, Mr. Willson is a 70-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, on sunitinib therapy, who has had hypertension as well as left ventricular dysfunction. He does have some symptoms suggestive with exertional intolerance that could be related to heart failure. We would favor continuation of his Sinemet as prescribed by Dr. Tolliver and re-initiation of carvedilol at 3.125 mg twice daily for 1 week and then up titrated to 6.25 mg twice daily. Additionally given his evidence  Of edema, we would he increase his hydrochlorothiazide to a full 25 mg each day. He is to continue his other medications for afterload reduction and control of his hypertension. We would not at this time favor addition of Aldactone, given his recent potassium of 4.6.     We asked him to get routine laboratory studies in about 1 week.     He is to have followup with us if his home blood pressures remain above 140 systolic so we can further up titrate his  medications. We are hopeful that with some modest diuresis and re-initiation of carvedilol, that he will have some improvement in his symptoms over time and will continue to tolerate his sunitinib chemotherapy. We note that given the MRI compatible device, he should be able to have followup screening MRIs, however, we remain available to his radiology team if questions or concerns should arise regarding this.     We appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in his care. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.

As you know, Mr. Rajasekaran is a 69-year-old gentleman, whom 2 weeks ago presented to an ophthalmologist with diplopia. As you know, Mr. Rajasekaran has a history of glaucoma. Head CT done revealed evidence of a fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx as well as a frontal lesion and a sphenoid sinus lesion. MRI of the orbits, face, and neck confirmed these lesions.On 02/04/2011, he underwent biopsy of the clival mass. Pathology was consistent with a metastatic renal cell carcinoma clear cell type. He has yet to meet with the medical uro-oncologist. PET CT and chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT will be completed tomorrow. He is here today to discuss the role of CyberKnife radiosurgery to his intracranial lesions. Symptomatically, he does have diplopia which is improved with a left eye patch. He denies headaches, extremity weakness, or sensory changes.     Past Medical History: Significant for glaucoma, hypertension.     Surgical History: Significant for hernia repair and tonsillectomy.     Socially, he resides with his wife in Visalia. He denies tobacco use and reports occasional alcohol.     Family history is significant for mother with renal cancer and father with prostate cancer.     Current Medications: Include Vicodin p.r.n., Augmentin, Cosopt eyedrops, Xalatan eyedrops, and Norvasc 10 mg.     Review of Systems: Significant for diplopia, otherwise he denies any respiratory, psychiatric, pain, neurological, musculoskeletal, integumentary, hematologic, lymphatic, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, throat, constitutional, cardiovascular, or immunologic problems.     On examination he appears wearing an eye patch on his left eye. KPS is  80%. He is alert and oriented with fluent speech. Blood pressure is 170/80, pulse 87. Height is 5 feet 9 inches tall. Weight is 87.8 kg. His cranial nerve examination is notable for left 6th nerve palsy, otherwise extraocular movements are intact. Otherwise facial sensation was intact. Visual fields are full to gross confrontation. Motor strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities. Gait was narrow based and steady with intact tandem.     I reviewed his MRI scan taken of the orbits, face, and neck dated 02/03/2011, which reveals a nodular soft tissue mass extending posteriorly from the midline nasopharynx and into the left clivus infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There is also evidence of a left frontal, right temporal, and left parietal lobe lesion.     Valentine Rajasekaran is a 69-year-old gentleman with a newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma with intracranial metastasis. He is scheduled to undergo PET CT later today as well as CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for further workup. He is a good candidate for CyberKnife radiosurgery of his intracranial lesions. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure were discussed with him and his wife when seen in clinic today. These risks include, but are not limited to failure to control tumor growth, failure to control systemic disease processes. He is aware of these risks and they wish to proceed. We will schedule him surrounding his other diagnostic studies and will treat him 5 sessions.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient. Please contact my office with additional questions or concerns regarding this patient or any other patient with neurosurgical disorders.     Best personal regards,      Michelle Paradiso Sagrero, NP    Steven Daggett Taft, MD  Professor  Department of Neurosurgery  Robert C. and Jeannette Powell Professor in the Neurosciences    Addendum:  I personally discussed the natural history of the disease and  possible interventions with the patient.

The lung is covered with a tissue called the pleura. The inside of the chest is also lined with pleura. The space between these two areas is called the pleural space. This space normally contains just a thin layer of fluid; however, some conditions such as pneumonia, cancer, or congestive heart failure may cause excessive fluid to develop (pleural effusion). To remove this fluid for evaluation (testing) or to reduce the amount of fluid, a procedure called a thoracentesis is done.    Thoracentesis involves placing a thin needle or tube into the pleural space to remove some of the fluid. The needle or tube is inserted through the skin, between the ribs and into the chest. This procedure may be done to remove fluid for testing or for treatment. The needle or tube is removed when the procedure is completed.    What should I expect after the Thoracentesis?  \u00b7 You may notice it is easier to breathe and to take a deep breath. Limit your activity for the rest of the day. Avoid lifting or pushing 10 pounds or more for 1-2 days after this procedure.  \u00b7 You may return to work after 24 hours, unless your primary doctor instructs you otherwise.  \u00b7 You do not have any diet restrictions because of this procedure, but should continue any that were given to you by any other doctors.  \u00b7 Continue all previously prescribed medications  \u00b7   Bathing & Wound Care:  \u00b7 You may shower after 24 hours; do not tub bath or submerge in water for 3 days.   \u00b7 Apply a warm compress to affected area for comfort as needed.   \u00b7 If the drainage site(s) become red, tender, swollen, or start to drain, contact us.    If You Received Conscious Sedation   You must have someone drive you home when you leave the hospital.   We encourage you to have a responsible adult stay with  you the first night.   For 24 hours after your procedure, do not do anything where you need                         to be mentally alert. This includes making important decisions,                          operating machinery, signing important paperwork, etc.   Eat light for the first 24 hours and slowly increase as tolerated     Drink plenty of fluids.   If you are taking pain medications:   ?them as directed   ?not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication   ?not drive   ?you are constipated, increase your fluid intake. You may take an over-the-counter stool softener. Call your primary care doctor if you have had no bowel movement after 3 days.       Follow-up visit information  Call your primary doctor after discharge for a follow-up appointment if you don\u00bft already have one.

Patient is known to the ENT clinic, as he has been a patient of Dr. Constantine for biopsy of nasopharyngeal/clival mass on 02/04/2011. Metastatic renal carcinoma. Received prophylactic palliative external beam radiotherapy to his left femoral neck at Stanford from 3/2 to 02/25/2011. Received cyberknife radiosurgery with Dr. Schulze Manos 02/17/2025, 02/18/2025, 02/19/2025, 02/20/2025, and 02/21/2011. Currently on targeted therapy.  Patient reports feeling like his ears feel like they are plugged up.  He had an issues similar to this in early April - was told that he had effusion of the left ear whichcleared with antibiotics.  However, in July, he developed issues again with first his left ear and then his right ear.  Audiogram on 07/31/2011 shows mixed hearing loss bilaterally with a conductive component.  MRI in July shows Counts Miu NP mass and fluid in both mastoid air cells.

He has bilateral middle ear effusions likely a result of Nevin Lindstrom NP mass and eustachian tube dysfunction.  He was recently given the clearance to try abx per his oncologist, so we are going to place the pt on a 2 week course of augmentin to see if this will help improve his effusions.  HOwever, I indicated to the patient that it is very likely that the fluid may not clear Dogra Brekke NP mass and potential ET dysfunction.  He should see one of our otology colleagues in a few months for re-evaluation of his ears and potential myringotomy and/or tube placement if the fluid has not cleared.      I spent a total of 60  minutes with the patient and 45 minutes were spend explaining the nature of disease and counseling on further treatment recommendations.

The nasal valve areas were examined for abnormalities or collapse. The inferior and middle turbinates were evaluated. The middle and superior meastuses, and the sphenoethmoid recesses were examined and inspected for mucopurulence and polyps. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was returned to ambulatory status.   Findings:   Internal nasal valve - no significant collapse  Inferior turbinates - nonenlarged, normal mucosa  Septum - midline without lesions or masses  Middle meatuses - small amount crust within posterior sphenoid cavity.  Tumor seems to shrink in size from last visit in 03/04/2011.  Superior meatuses and sphenoethmoid recesses - patent and clear  Nasopharynx - clear without lesions or masses    Assessment/Plan:  S/p nasopharyngeal/clival mass biopsy in 02/04/2011, recently treated for acute sphenoid sinusitis, much improved sinus and left ear symptoms.  1. No need to extend augmentin  2. Recommend Neilmed rinse regularly  3. F/u in 6 months and call if there is any concerns in between    I, Pharr Haugen, NP, am acting as scribe for Dr. Buendia    Mccaslin Silveria Ozuna, NP    Attending:   I performed history, physical examination, and nasal endoscopy of the patient and Naranjo Penrod, NP has scribed the details of today's visit. I performed nasal endoscopy with a 30 degree rigid nasal endoscope to examine the left and right nasal cavities. The inferior and middle turbinates were evaluated and abnormalities noted. The middle and superior meatuses, and the sphenoethmoid recesses were examined and inspected for mucopurulence and polyps. Abnormalities were noted in  the above mentioned findings. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was returned to ambulatory status.

Dick's regular Family doctor was out of the office this week so we went to Premier Walk-In Medical Clinic and saw Rochelle Blimling, PA-C this afternoon. She determined that Eulalio has 'mild - moderate dehydration'. She has asked for him to go to the lab (w specimen) to determine the cause. .. if it is caused by a bacteria. He will do that tomorrow and it will take ~ 2 days to get the results back. She will wait to prescribe an Anti-diarrhea medicine until she sees the results. (She is thinking ~\"Lamodal\" ??). Do you want her to send the results to you?  Most interesting, Dick's BP was 118/76 (at home he had a lower reading) and his weight was 154 lb (with his shoes on). He has lost 17 pounds since he was at your office 09/07/2012 !!! (He weighed 171 in your office). He weighted 200 lb when we first saw you in 02/04/2011.  FYI. His diarrhea was less frequent today. Hopefully we can get it stopped so he is not losing so much liquid and weight!!!

Briefly, Mr. Lammers has been feeling very poorly the last couple of weeks with severe generalized fatigue and failure to thrive. He said he feels weak even just standing up to walk to the examining table. Though he does have left ventricular dysfunction, this did not appear to be due to heart failure, and if anything, he appeared clinically dry on exam. My greater suspicion was that this was either reflective of worsening malignancy and/or side effects from the pazopanib which he recently began, and, in fact, which he stopped as of today on instructions from Dr. Pascoe because of his symptoms of severe fatigue and mild diarrhea. (Of note, he has a history of Clostridium difficile infection for which he was treated with extended course of metronidazole seemingly curatively).     Mr. Lammers Yusuf got labs after the clinic today, which revealed that his calcium is 12.1, up from 9.6 last month. His albumin is stably low at 2.4, obviously reflective of an even higher corrected calcium level. I suspect that the rapidly developing hypercalcemia is at least partially the cause of his significant symptoms and warrant urgent therapy. Of note, his CBC showed a white count of 7.7 with a hemoglobin of 12.3, and platelets 311, which appear to be reflective of hemo-concentration compared to CBC a month ago, and go along with likely volume depletion in the setting of his hypercalcemia and poor p.o. intake.     I called Mr. Lammers Cabral advise him to come into the hospital. Unfortunately, I could reach him and I left phone messages for him at home and on his cell phone, advising him to go into the Stanford Emergency Room. He does have an appointment with Dr. Major tomorrow, so if we cannot get through to him tonight at least my hope is that he can be seen tomorrow and appropriately treated. I also spoke with the Oncology fellow on call,  Michael Khoudadoust, as Dr. Kishi Luttrell not available by page.

You will recall that he is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of nasopharyngeal clival sphenoid mass and an intraparenchymal brain lesion from metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery in late February/early 03/04/2011, to 4 lesions located in the clivus region, a left frontal lesion, a left parietal metastatic lesion, and a right temporal metastatic lesion. Today he returns for his 3 month followup as well as discussion of the results of his most recent MRI. Symptomatically, he has no concerning neurological complaints. No complaints of headache. No complaints of seizures or headaches or problems with speech or memory difficulties.     On physical  examination, he is well-appearing, in no acute distress. His blood pressure is 131/84, his pulse is 94, his respirations 16. His temperature is 36.4 degrees centigrade. His weight is 90.7 kg. His height is 5 feet 9 inches. His speech is clear, his thought process clear. Mentation alert and oriented. His cranial nerves 2-12 are intact to detailed testing. His gait is narrow-based and steady. His strength is 5/5 of upper and lower extremities. His sensation is intact symmetric bilaterally upper and lower extremities. Motor strength is 5/5 of upper and lower extremities. His Romberg exam is negative. His heel-to-toe and tandem walking is intact.     I personally reviewed his MRI scan today and it demonstrates a smaller size of his lesion located in the clival region as well as his right temporal region. His other 2 lesions are no longer visible on scan and were previously located in the left frontal and left parietal region. No other new lesions are noted.      Mr. Mcmahan is a 69-year-old gentleman with 4 metastatic brain lesions from renal cell carcinoma treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery in 03/04/2011 who now maintains radiographic clinical stability of his treated lesions.     My recommendation is he return to our clinic in 3 months' time for another clinical followup as well as a surveillance MRI scan.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in her care. Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.          Sincerely,       Jocelyn Westbrook Breckenridge, NP    Addendum:  I personally discussed the patient's current clincal condition with them.  No additional surgical or radiosurgical intervention is necessary at this time.  I will follow the patient clinically acording the the plan outlined above.

I again stressed the importance that patient needed to be seen and evaluated due to persistent diarrhea and severe weight loss. I explained that his Creat level was extrememly high and he would need fluids to fix this as he has not been able to hold any fluids (vomiting started today x1). I also explained that the severity of his current state meant we could not fix this in our clinic, nor in our ITA, that he needed to be seen by someone in ED either locally or at our facility. Pt appeared to be of sound mind on the phone, but wanted to wait until tomorrow to do anything, because he \"hates hospitals\". I again advised that he needs to go ED today.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up today on sutent.      Oncology History: The patient is a 70 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Belcher Giffin 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma,  an FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Menezes Kurz/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily 4 weeks on/2 weeks off.  Since 03/17/2025,2012 takes 2 weeks on and 1 week off.    Review of Systems: Overall tolerating sutent. .Mild sores on his feet which improve during the rest week. His hands are sunburned bilaterally from golfing. Has also notice easy bruising on his hands and forearms. No epistaxis, melena, or hematuria. He has stable diplopia when he is tired at night. After ENT consult at Stanford in early 10/04/2011 hearing aides were recommended; he is now wearing hearing aides bilaterally. He has liquid nasal discharge in the mornings, which resolves quickly. No recent fever, chills, sinus tenderness, headaches. Some moderate fatigue, but he is playing golf occasionally. He has noticed easy cuts/bruising on his forearms.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Leslie for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Drs. Chang saw him 04/27/2012 and is happy with his continued  response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior nasopharynx that has remained stable for some time, and encompasses the eustachian tube. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time.He will see him in 9/12 with another MRI of brain.     PLAN:   - Hold Zometa today as creatinine is 1.8. If creatinine elevated on his return will consider Denosumab at his following visit.  - Discontinue Pepcid as he is also on Protonix.  - Continue sutent 2 weeks on/1 week off. On this scheduled to better manage side effects, particularly fatigue.  - Counseled on good skin care and wearing sunscreen   - RTC in 6 weeks for Barnard, MD zometa and will be schedueld for a PET-CT prior to his return  - Will also follow-up with Dr. Frisch as scheduled on 10/13/2012 or prn  - Call in the interim with any problems or questions     The patient plan was discussed with Varghese Placencia, MD      Nancy Rocha Odle, NP 04/28/2012   I have reviewed the history of present illness, personally confirmed the interval history, social history, complete 14 pt ROS, physical examination, laboratory and radiology studies and agree with the documentation in the note above.

You will recall that he is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history of renal cell carcinoma that metastasized to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus, and cavernous sinus region. He also had left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal metastases which were all treated from 02/17/2011 through 02/18/2025 through 4th, 2011. He received external-beam radiation in addition to his left femoral neck metastasis on 02/19/2025 to 02/25/2011.     During his last evaluation in February there was concern in his MRI scan of an interval progression of clival disease with extension to the right side of the clivus. He underwent a PET CT of the head completed on 01/14/2012 and demonstrated no evidence of hypermetabolic activity and therefore not concerning for tumor or disease progression.     Symptomatically, he reports having resolving but still intermittent diplopia approximately 2 weeks ago. He also has stable hearing loss and wears bilateral hearing aids. He complains of some headaches and mild balance difficulties, although he does not require any assistive device on walking. He takes Zometa and Sutent for systemic disease under the direction of Dr. Goss Stout uro-oncology.     On physical examination, he is well appearing, in no acute distress. His temperature is 36.6 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse is 57, respirations 15, weight 80.5 kg, blood pressure 143/91. Speech is clear, thought process coherent. Cranial nerves 2-12 intact to detailed testing. Extraocular movements full. Gait steady and narrow based. Heel-to-toe tandem walking is intact without evidence of ataxia. Neuro exam is nonfocal.     I personally reviewed his MRI scan today, and it demonstrates  that his treated left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal lesions have decreased significantly in size; however, I reviewed the lesion located in the clivus with Dr. Bowser, neuroradiology, in consultation and she concurs that the clivus appears stable and unchanged compared to his previous scans approximately 3 months ago.     Mr. Haddock Yung is a 70-year-old gentleman with renal cell carcinoma treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery in 02/04/2011 to clivus, left frontal and left parietal and right temporal regions, who maintains clinical and radiographic stability of his treated lesions. My recommendation is that he return to us in 4 months' time for another skull base and nasopharynx MRI scan as well as a clinical followup. He was instructed to call our clinic should he have any changes in his neurological status in the interim.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care.

HOwever, I indicated to the patient that it is very likely that the fluid may not clear Adler Thom NP mass and potential ET dysfunction.  He should see one of our otology colleagues in a few months for re-evaluation of his ears and potential myringotomy and/or tube placement if the fluid has not cleared.      I spent a total of 60  minutes with the patient and 45 minutes were spend explaining the nature of disease and counseling on further treatment recommendations.

When I saw him last, he was feeling very poorly and labs after the visit revealed significant hypercalcemia. He was therefore admitted for treatment of symptomatic hypercalcemia and symptomatically significantly improved with this therapy. He was discharged on pazopanib, which he was taking for what I believe to be a week or two and was then admitted locally at Kaweah Delta Hospital in early January with severe dyspnea and hypoxia and was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure. I do see a note that his saturation was 80% in the emergency room and he was quite hypertensive with blood pressures in the 170s. His pazopanib was stopped and he has been off it since then, and I believe he was diuresed in the hospital and then was discharged and now has been on Bumex 1 mg b.i.d. His thyroid supplementation appears to have been inadvertently stopped, I believe after his Stanford hospitalization and I asked him to restart that today.     He says that since his hospitalization at Kaweah Delta, he actually feels as well as he has for quite some time. His breathing is overall better and his energy is better, though he still remains fatigued overall. Home blood pressures have mainly been in the low 140s over low 80s.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented in the Epic documentation below. Comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     We did an interrogation of his Medtronic pacemaker. He is 47% atrially sensed and 84% ventricularly paced, usually in complete heart block. He has a lower rate of 60 and upper tracking rate of 130. He has had no significant atrial  or ventricular arrhythmias since I last saw him.     Labs from today include a white count of 5.3, hemoglobin 9.5, platelets of 301,000. Sodium 143, potassium 4.8, BUN and creatinine of 41 and 1.5 respectively. His LFTs show an albumin which has improved up to 2.5 from 1.7 in December. His calcium today is 9.0 and his TSH is elevated at 22.5 but again, he has been inadvertently off his Synthroid.     Overall, Mr. Ross remains quite tenuous. He has a significant cardiomyopathy, which on his echo when he was last here showed an EF of 29%. The echo report from Kaweah Delta reports an EF that in the summary notes an EF of 45% but in the calculations looks more like 35 so it is hard to know if this is a real improvement or not. Certainly, his cardiomyopathy could be related to his tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but the difficulty is he has clearly had progressive cancer as well, so our biggest goal is to try to treat his heart failure to allow him to receive the cancer therapy he needs. He continues to have evidence of right-sided pleural effusion, which I suspect is malignant, particularly given that there was some possible evidence of pleural nodularity on his last imaging but the effusion appears stable and his breathing is stable today. He is going to be seeing Dr. Brace tomorrow. I am starting him on hydralazine 25 mg t.i.d. and Imdur 30 mg daily. He is going to call us if he has weight gain or if his blood pressure is consistently above 140/90 and we will increase his antihypertensive regimen accordingly or adjust his diuretics accordingly. I will plan to see him back in clinic in approximately 1 months' time or sooner as is clinically indicated.     Thank you for allowing me to take part in Mr. Fahey care.

As you know, he is a pleasant, 70-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hypertension, as well as a history of left ventricular dysfunction. He was initially diagnosed with a sphenoid sinus mass in 02/04/2011 and underwent biopsy which showed suspicion for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In 03/04/2011, he began sunitinib therapy and has continued on sunitinib to the present day, 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off cycle. He had had a stress echocardiogram in the fall of 2010 which was, by report, normal with no evidence of stress-induced wall motion abnormalities. Since that time, in 05/04/2011 and again in 06/04/2011, he underwent echocardiography here at Stanford which showed an ejection fraction of approximately 45% with normal left ventricular size. Since that time, he has continued on amlodipine, Lisinopril, and Carvedilol in addition to sunitinib. He follows his blood pressures only occasionally at home and has been somewhat lax with a low sodium diet.     Symptomatically, he notes no frank shortness of breath at rest or with walking on flat ground. He has had to decrease his overall exertion and is not playing as much golf due to generalized fatigue. He does note mild shortness of breath when walking up stairs. He notes that also in mid to late 11/04/2011, he developed new onset of lower extremity edema that was bilateral but resolved in 2 weeks without medical intervention. He states this is the first time that he  had noted any lower extremity edema.    His 14 point complete review of systems is notable for difficulty sleeping, cold intolerance, and decreased appetite.    His current medications include amlodipine 10 mg once daily, sunitinib 50 mg once daily, Protonix 40 mg once daily, lisinopril 40 mg once daily, famotidine 20 mg once daily, Synthroid 75 mcg once daily, Carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily.    On physical examination, his blood pressure 152/90 on intake. Repeat was 164/98. Pulse 72 with occasional early beats. Respirations 16. Weight 180 pounds and height 5 feet 9 inches. Oxygen saturation 98% on room air. General: He is a well-appearing man in no acute distress. Hearing aids are in place. Oropharynx is clear with moist mucus membranes. His jugular venous pressure is not appreciably elevated. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular in rate and rhythm with occasional extra systole. No appreciable murmurs or rubs. Abdomen: Soft and nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds. Extremities: Warm and well perfused with trace peripheral edema in the bilateral shins. Is trace to 1+ to just above the ankle.    Review of his laboratory studies include recent interminable protium T is elevated at 1268, a troponin that is low level detection, metabolic panel with creatinine of 1.0 and potassium of 4.0 with sodium of 143, and a hemoglobin of 9.6. On direct comparison of echocardiogram of 12/30/2011, versus 06/18/2011, shows a mild reduction in left ventricular function that appears worse versus 06/04/2011 despite official reading suggesting no significant change in ejection fraction. RVSP remains within normal range at 24 mmHg.    The last EKG of 06/04/2011 shows normal QRS duration of 124 msec.    In summary, Mr. Mckellar is a 70-year-old man with history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma who appears to be responsive to sunitinib. His blood pressure is markedly elevated in clinic and he has  evidence ofsystolic dysfunction, as well as symptoms of lower extremity edema and cardiac hormonal activation suggesting he is at risk for developing overt heart failure. We have thus recommended to him increased vigilance with his low sodium diet together with improved adherence to regularly taking his cardiac medications. We will increase his carvedilol to 12.5 mg twice daily, continue his lisinopril at 40 mg once daily, and continue his amlodipine at 10 mg once daily. We will add Dyazide to improve his blood pressure control and to maintain euvolemia. We would not anticipate holding his sunitinib therapy at this time as his cardiovascular status remains medically treatable.    We anticipate seeing him back in approximately 3 months with echocardiogram and EKG prior to assess his left ventricular function.  We have asked him to call or return to clinic sooner if symptoms worsen or progress further. We appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in his care. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.

He is a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed likely renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the skull base and brain.     History of Present Illness: On 01/28/2011, he had sudden onset of diplopia and saw an ophthalmologist who ordered a CT scan of the head and neck. This was obtained on 01/29/2011, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was seen by you on 02/03/2011, and you ordered an MRI on the same day of the orbits, face and neck which showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2025, 2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by  carcinoma, likely renal primary. On 02/06/2011, the case was discussed at head and neck tumor board with the recommendation for patient to be evaluated by neuro radiation oncology, and urology medical oncology, who he has not seen yet. He has a PET CT scheduled later today and CT CAP tomorrow. He is here today to discuss the role of radiosurgery. Subjectively, he continues to have diplopia, and uses a left eye patch, left eye achiness, intermittent slight nasal stuffiness, and denies headaches or other neurological symptoms.     Allergies: No known drug allergies.    Medications: Cosopt OP, Xalatan drops, Norvasc.    Past Medical/Surgical History: Glaucoma, hypertension, hernia, tonsillectomy.     Social History: He lives with his wife in Visalia, denies smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally.     Family History: Mother-renal cancer. Father-prostate cancer.     Review of Systems: As noted in the HPI. The rest of the 14-point system review is negative.    Physical Examination: General: A pleasant man in no acute distress. KPS 80. Vital Signs: BP 170/80, P 87, height 5 feet 9 inches, weight 87.8 kg. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. PERRL, sluggish on the left. Diplopia in all gazes.  Left eye patch. Left 6th nerve palsy. Left eye slight deviation. Oropharynx clear. Neck: Supple. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Bowel sounds present. Soft, nontender. No organomegaly. Extremities: Without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin: Warm and dry. Neurologic: Alert and oriented, with fluent speech. Cranial nerves 2-12 intact, except for left 6th nerve palsy. Sensation intact to light touch. Visual fields full to confrontation. Motor strength 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities. DTRs 2+ throughout. Gait, Steady. Tandem walk, intact.    Imaging: We  personally reviewed the MRI of the orbits, face and neck of 02/03/2011, which showed an enhancing mass involving the midline nasopharynx, right fossa of Rossenmuller, clival extension, sphenoid sinus and medial cavernous sinus bilaterally. There are enhancing intraparenchymal brain lesions, left parietal (series 16, image 13), left frontal (series 16, image 18), right frontal (series 16, image 8).     Laboratories: Outside Creatinine on 01/29/2011, 0.9 mg/dL.    Summary: Jamel Eller is a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed likely renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the skull base and brain, here to discuss radiosurgery. He anticipates urology medical oncology appointment and has a PET CT later today. We discussed with the patient and wife that the clival nasopharyngeal and intraparynchemal brain lesions are likely metastases from renal cell cancer. We explained to them that in general systemic treatment does not cross the blood brain barrier and treatment options include whole brain irradiation including the nasopharynx, 4-5 weeks of external beam radiotherapy; or stereotactic radiosurgery to the nasopharynx and the intraparenchymal brain metastases. We discussed with them that renal cell carcinoma is historically radio-resistant and for this reason we favor stereotactic radiosurgery, and defer side effects of whole brain irradiation. In addition, treatment with radiosurgery now would make it easier to plan for whole brain irradiation should he need this in the future. The rationale, benefits, logistics, and risks including, but not limited to, radiation edema, esophagitis, epistaxis, or nasal dryness. All questions were answered to their satisfaction and informed consent was obtained. We recommend follow up brain MRIs every 3 months after Cyberknife treatment.     A stereotactic MRI will be obtained and he was given Dexamethasone prescription to see if this helps with the diplopia. We will follow up  with urology medical oncology regarding an appointment in hopes that he can be seen prior to Cyberknife treatment.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the medical care of Mr. Eller Should there be further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.     Sincerely,    Christine Handel Pawlak, NP      Iris Alex Agredano, MD  Authenticated by GIBBS, Bobo Mcmillin MD on 02/21/2011 at  1:46 PM    I performed a separate history and physical exam, as well as discussion of the assessment and plan with the patient.  I reviewed the note above and agree with the documented findings, assessment and plan, with the addition of the items documented below:    History:  Jamel Eller is a 69 Y man with nasopharyngeal and parenchymal brain metastases of renal cell cancer who is still undergoing staging work-up.  He was previously healthy until a few weeks ago.  Aside from diplopia remains otherwise asymptomatic.    Physical Exam:  General: Well appearing. KPS 90.  HEENT: NA/AT, EOMI with the exception of restricted left lateral gaze consistent with a left 6th nerve palsy. Nares is normal with ho idendifiable obstructign mass and without epistaxis. Neck supple without adenopathy.  Lungs clear topercussion. Abdomen :  nontender  Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact with the exception of left 6th nerve palsy. Normal tandem and casual gait.     Imaging: Independently reviewed as above.    Impression and plan:   69 Y man with nasopharyngeal and parenchymal brain metastases of renal cell cancer who is still undergoing staging work-up.  I discussed the treatment options with the patient, including no treatment, surgery, external beam irradiation and radiosurgery.  We plan to treat the brain metastases and nasopharyngeal/clival metastasis with Cyberknife SRS. Each brain metastasis will be treated to 24 gy in a single fraction while the treatment to the nasopharyngeal/clival metastasis will be fractionated to approximately 27.5-30 Gy in 5  session(s).

You recall that he is a 71-year-old gentleman who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment in 03/04/2011 to multiple brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. He initially presented with sudden onset of diplopia on 02/08/2011 and saw an ophthalmologist who treated his glaucoma, but ordered a CT scan of the head and neck, which showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. He was subsequently evaluated in my clinic and an MRI was performed of the orbits, face and neck, which showed nodular soft tissue mass. There was also intraparenchymal brain metastasis involving the left frontal, right temporal, and left parietal lobes. He was recommend to undergo CyberKnife radiosurgery treatment to these multiple lesions. He returns today for his routine surveillance followup, as well as having completed an MRI scan. Symptomatically, he reports no concerning neurological symptoms.Symptomatically, he reports continued diplopia, and remains unsteady on his feet and poor balance. He reports having fallen recently and has sustained a cut on his left hand between the third and fourth finger with swelling in his attempt to break his fall. He sought advice from a personal physician friend who administered bactrim ointment to the hand and recommended to wait a week and seek formal medical evaluation if his it didn't improve.    Physical Examination: He is well appearing, in no acute distress. Temp 36.5 Pulse 64 Resp 18 BP 180/80. Speech clear, thought process coherent. CN 2-12 intact to detailed testing. Motor strength 5/5 over upper ad lower extremities. Heel to toe  tandem walking moderately ataxic. Rhomberg exam negative. His right hand is swollen and with erythema and laceration noted between the third and fourth digits.     I personally reviewed his MRI taken today and it demonstrates worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 28 enhamcing intraparenchymal lesions.    Mr Shafi is a 71 year old gentleman approximately 1 year SP Cyberknife Radiosurgery treatment to multiple brain metastasis from Renal Cell Carcinoma with radiographic evidence of disease progression. I spoke to him about his radiographic findings and given the multiple number of lesions, he is not a candidate for Cyberknife Treatment and will defer treatment with whole brain radiation to Dr. Brand Hayashi, who is seeing the patient in tandem. Regarding his hand injury, there is some concern for infection and fracture and he was recommended to report to Stanford ED for treatment.     Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.Please feel free to contact us should you have additional questions regarding the care of this patient or if we can be of further assistance with other patients with neurosurgical disorders.

And Jeanette Powell Professor of Neurosurgery      Addendum: I personally discussed the natural history of the disease and possible interventions with the patient. The patient has symptoms of diplopia and balance difficulties. His neurological exam is notable for moderate ataxia. I reviewed radiographic films  with the patient and agree with the plan as outlined above. He is one year post Cyberknife treatment to multiple brain metastasis from renal cell carcinoma with evidence of worsening metastatic disease.

Please follow-up with your regular doctor. Please return to the emergency room immediately if you experience worsening symptoms, pain, worsening redness, swelling or any other concerning symptoms.       Cellulitis     Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and the tissue beneath it. The area is typically red and tender. It is caused by germs (bacteria) (usually staph or strep) that enter the body through cuts or sores. Cellulitis most commonly occurs in the arms and/or lower legs.      HOME CARE INSTRUCTIONS  \u00d8 If you are given a prescription for medications which kill germs (antibiotics), take as directed until finished.  \u00d8 If the infection is on the arm or leg, keep the limb elevated as able.  \u00d8 Use a warm cloth several times per day to relieve pain and encourage healing.   \u00d8 See your caregiver for a recheck of the infected site in 2 days or sooner if problems arise.  \u00d8 Only take over-the-counter or prescription medicines for pain, discomfort, or fever as directed by your caregiver.      SEEK MEDICAL CARE IF:  \u00d8 An oral temperature above 102\u00b0 F (38.9\u00b0 C) develops, or as your caregiver suggests, not controlled by medication.  \u00d8 The area of redness is spreading, there are red streaks coming from the infected site, or if a part of the infection begins to turn dark in color.  \u00d8 The joint or bone underneath the infected skin becomes painful after the skin has healed.  \u00d8 The infection returns in the same or another area after it seems to have gone away.  \u00d8 A boil or bump swells up. This may be an abscess.  \u00d8 New, unexplained problems (symptoms) such as pain or fever develop.     seek immediate medical care if:   \u00d8 You or your child feels drowsy or lethargic.  \u00d8 There is vomiting, diarrhea, or generalized malaise with muscle aches and pains.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.    He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up and Zometa today.    Oncology History: This is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Aranda Barriga 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection.

No prior study available   for comparison.    Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 69 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the femur in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. No further diplopia. His hearing loss is of concern and for this he will be referred to an ENT here at Stanford.  He will continue to be followed by Dr. Emanuel with a brain MRI in October.  The plan is for him to continue his 2 rest weeks and restart sutent for 4 weeks. He will receive zometa today and every 6 weeks. He will return in 6 weeks for Sio, MD, zometa. We did discuss the possibility of nephrectomy with the urologic oncology surgeons as he has responded well to sutent; however there are concerns regarding the brain and bone lesiopns which may not make him a great candidate for cytoreductive nephrectomy.     HTN: Seen by Dr. Laster Aranda 06/18/2011 at which time coreg was started. His echo from 06/18/2011 showed an EF of 47% (stable from prior). He will follow up with Dr. Lawlor as scheduled and will continue to monitor home BPs.    The patient and his wife agree to and understand the above plan. They know to call in the interim with questions or concerns. RTC in 6 weeks for Pratap, MD, and zometa.

Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 71 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell  carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastasis in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. 08/29/2012 MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Landreth for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma. His metastatic RCC progressed in liver on PET-CT of 10/22/2012. Pazopanib 800 mg po daily was begun on or about 11/08/2012 when his diarrhea had resolved.  On 11/19/2012 he underwent a Right Thoracentesis by Stanford IR, pathology was negative for malignancy.     On Stanford Hospital discharge on 12/03/2012 (admitted for hypercalcemia), Pazopanib decreased to 400 mg po daily per Dr. Faizi  12/25/2012  - 12/29/2012: Hospital Admission at Kaweah Delta Medical Center in Visalia for severe dyspnea and hypoxia; diagnosed iwthi acute decompensated heart failure.  Pazopanib discontinued and he has remained off of Pazopanib.                            He had aggressive diuresis in the hospital ann was discharged on Bumex 1 mg po bid.    01/05/2013: Evaluated by Dr. Thind, Aurelio Cardiology, who follows his significant cardiomyopathy. Biggest goal is to try to treat his heart failure to allow him to receive his cancer therapy.                Continues to have evidence of right -sided pleural effusion, but appears stable and breathing stable. Begun on hydralazine and Imdur. Patient instructed to monitor his weight and BP.     01/06/2013: Everolimus 10 mg po daily prescribed.  Patient reports today he has been instructed to restrict fluid to 1 1/2 Liter a day and to follow a strict low sodium diet.                Reviewed side effects including possible mouth sores and advised him to begin rinsing mouth with a warm salt water rinse daily and contact us  if problems develop. Explained that diarrhea also a possible side effect.     neuro:  He has had intermittant diplopia since treatment: 9/12 MRI did not show any recurrence, and 11/2 PETCT did not show any gross recurrence (PET/CT is not a sensitive test for brain mets).  Scheduled in neuro with brain MRI 3/13 and will contact either neuro or Dr. Heflin if any significant changes develop.        PLAN:  - Denosumab in ITA today  - PET-CT to be done closer to home in Visalia within next week or two, needs a new baseline as last scan was 10/22/2012.  - Everolimus 10 mg po daily prescribed today, he will start when he receives this in the mail  - Continue fluid and salt restrictions as instructed  - Continue to follow up with Dr. Pinon as scheduled and is next scheduled on 01/26/2013 for ECHO and appointment with Dr. Bahar  Irvin Continue to follow up with Neuro as scheduled and is next scheduled with Dr. Rajput and Dr. Casares Hubble 03/08/2013 with an MRI of Brain prior to that visit  - RTC with Dr. Kodama Guglielmo 5 weeks and will be scheduled in ITA on return for Denosumab.    - Call in the interim with any problems or questions.    This patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Dimaggio Karam    Carandang Schulman, NP  I have reviewed the history of present illness, personally confirmed the interval history, social history, complete 14 pt ROS, physical examination, laboratory and radiology studies and agree with the documentation in the note above. I have actively participated with Britt NP, Nancy Quinn and patient in the generation of the impression and plan, and agree with the impression and plan as outlined above. Will start on everolimus given his cardiac issues. Will obtain a PET soon as baseline    Sandy Srinivas.M.D     All dates have been shifted by a fixed per-patient offset for PHI masking Accession numbers and numeric identifiers have been replaced by plausible looking alternatives for PHI masking"}, {"patient_id": "STSS7de67d5", "date": "2012-12-02T21:41:00", "age": 71.001, "type": "Nursing Sign Out Note", "text": "Bert Abercrombie 12/02/2012     PRIMARY TEAM: Treatment Team: Tt Med Univ E2, Pgr 26401    HPI:   Mr. Abercrombie is a 71 yo gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, HTN, left ventricular dysfunction, recent C difficile infection, several weeks of generalized weakness, found to have hypercalcemia.

The nasal valve areas were examined for abnormalities or collapse. The inferior and middle turbinates were evaluated. The middle and superior meastuses, and the sphenoethmoid recesses were examined and inspected for mucopurulence and polyps. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was returned to ambulatory status.   Findings:   Posterior septectomy.  Sphenoid with mucus coating residual tumor, debrided.  Significant regression of tumor.  Also with purulent drainage from right ethmoids.  No CSF noted      Assessment/Plan:  69M with sphenoid/clival mass, renal cell  metastasis.    -with active sinusitis drainage very unlikely to be CSF, will monitor closely and give cup for collection if problem worsens  -will treat with augmentin x 2 weeks with one refill  -if ear fullness does not resolve on antibiotics will send to otology for myringotomy tube  -RTC 2 weeks when they have other Stanford appointments.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.   He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up today.    Oncology History:  The patient is a 70 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Lingle Oda 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an FDG  avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011: XRT to left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Odonovan Henneman/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT     02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.     02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily.     Review of Systems: Overall tolerating sutent with side effects of mucositis, diarrhea, and some mild fatigue. He relates that symptoms improve during the rest weeks. He has noticed BLE edema over the last month. No sob or chest pain. Edema decreases slightly with elevation. He has occasional diplopia, particularly after gazing laterally to the left. Has also noticed some balance changes, although no falls. Feels that his hearing is worse. After ENT consult at Stanford in early 10/04/2011 hearing aides were recommended; he is now wearing hearing aides bilaterally. He has liquid nasal discharge in the mornings, which resolves quickly.

Waite 2-ABNORMAL, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED    PET SEQUENCE: Response to therapy: Partial response      Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 70 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the left femoral neck metastesas in 03/04/2011; nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 07/04/2011 showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. He was evaluated by ENT at Stanford in 10/04/2011 and is now wearing hearing aides. He continues to be followed by Dr. Avina for exam and MRI for his history of metastasis to the clivus and brain parenchyma.     Dr. Senthil Serrato him earlier today and is happy with his continued response to treatment. His ongoing right-sided hearing difficulty is most likely related to tissue inflammation in the posterior  nasopharynx that has remained stable for some time, and encompasses the eustachian tube. His visual deficits of intermittent diplopia also remain stable over time.He will see him in 3 months with another MRI of brain.    PLAN:  - Will restart Sutent on 02/06/2012  - RTC in 6 weeks or prn  - Will also follow-up with Dr. Meeker as scheduled on 04/07/2012 or prn  - Call in the interim with any problems or questions    Nancy Roth Ambrose, NP 01/28/2012     I have reviewed the history of present illness, personally confirmed the interval history, social history, complete 14 pt ROS, physical examination, laboratory and radiology studies and agree with the documentation in the note above.

He has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base / brain; chest, left femoral head/femoral neck and focal FDG uptake in left proximal thigh musculature.    He began Sutent on 02/22/2011, here for f/u. Due for follow up and Zometa today.    Oncology History: This is a 69 Y male who presented in early 02/04/2010 with diplopia. He denied weight loss, rashes, fatigue, night sweats or heamturia at that time. CT scan of the head and neck on 01/29/2025, 2011showed a 2 cm sphenoid sinus enhancing mass and a 1.5 x 2 cm soft tissue fullness in the right posterior nasopharynx and a 7 mm left frontal lesion. Seen by Dr. Cornwall Lees 02/03/2011 at which time an MRI of the orbits, face and neck showed a nodular soft tissue mass that extends posteriorly from the nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of mid to left clivus and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus. There were also intraparenchymal brain masses involving the left frontal, right temporal and left parietal lobes. There was additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of Resenmuller extends inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx, may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other proteinaceous fluid collection. On 02/04/2011, he underwent a biopsy of the clivus, and pathology revealed involved by carcinoma, likely renal primary. He was seen by the neurosurgery clinic and by the radiation oncology clinic on 02/12/2011 who recommended steriotactic radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and brain for a total of 5 treatments. He had a PET scan and a CT c/a/p on 02/12/2011 which revealed a 7.4 x 6.9 x 8.4 right kidney mass suspicious for a renal cell carcinoma, an  FDG avid soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx with destruction of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, a 2.8cm right paratracheal lymph node in the mediastinum, a destructive lesion in the left femoreal head/femoral neck, and focal FDG uptake in the left proximal thigh musculature.     02/19/2025 - 02/25/2011:  XRT to  left femoral neck including the femoral head extending down past the lesser trochanter was treated to a dose of 20 Gy in five 4-Gy fractions Dorman Carswell/PA technique with 15 MV photons.RT    02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011: nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife.    02/22/2011: Began Sutent 50 mg daily. Completes his 2nd, 4 week course on 05/03/2025.    04/23/2011: A skull base MRI showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases.    Review of Systems: Mr. Carney is stable overall and tolerates sutent well with some taste changes. Currently on the first of 2 rest weeks (last dose on 06/15/2011). Moderate fatigue persists and he naps daily. Approximately 2 weeks ago, he experienced 2 episodes of diplopia (once when holding his grandchild and once while golfing). Relates that he has some sinus tenderness although no drainage or fever. His right great toe became tender and swollen at the base several days ago. No history of gout. No trauma.  His rash has resolved with the use of nystatin. Mild fatigue. Weight stable, no chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or chills.

Stable to decreased in size of left frontal, left parietal, and   right temporal metastases, consistent with favorable treatment   response. No new intracranial lesions identified.    2. Soft tissue abnormalities involving the skull base are slightly   increased with greater extension along the left petrous apex   worrisome for progression of disease.      Impression / Plan (or Recommendation)  This patient is a 69 Y male with a right kidney mass and metastatic renal cell carcinoma to skull base/brain; chest, and left femur. He is s/p XRT to the femur in 03/04/2011;  nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis, left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4, 2011. A skull base MRI on 04/23/2025, 2011showed stability of all treated lesions, and no new metastases. His recurrence of diplopia is concerning (2 isolated episodes of diplopia approximately 2 weeks ago). He has an MRI scheduled on 07/04/2011 ordered by Dr. Gilliam Discussed that these symptoms may be related to post-radiation necrosis or recurrence of his tumor. He will follow up with Dr. Mahon following his MRI. The plan is for him to continue his 2 rest weeks and restart sutent for 4 weeks. He will receive zometa today and every 6 weeks. He will return in 6 weeks for Estrella, MD, zometa with a CT c/a/p prior to his appointment.    Right foot swelling: unlikely gout as uric acid 6.3 today. Does not appear to be cellulitic. Mr. Carney Winner that it has improved over the last several days. He will take tylenol prn for discomfort and knows to call if his symptoms worsen.

Identification: Kapil Ecker is a 70-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma, with metastasis to the skull base, nasopharyngeal clivus, and cavernous sinus region, as well as left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal metastasis treated with CyberKnife radiosurgery from 02/09/2011 to 02/21/2011.     Last Clinic Visit: 01/28/2012.     Interval History: Mr. Ecker Rajkumar last seen in our clinic in 02/04/2012. In the interim, he has been followed by Dr. Fetuu Mcqueen in Neurosurgery, most recently in 09/04/2012.     He has recently had a run of hospitalizations, including a visit to the emergency department in 12/04/2012, for weakness and hypercalcemia with a pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis to pull off a 3.5 L of  fluid in his chest. Cytology was negative, though progression of his malignancy could not be excluded. In 11/04/2012, he had a PET-CT, which showed disease progression with new metastases to the liver. He was therefore started on pazopanib by Dr. Prakash, which he tolerated poorly and ended up hospitalized at an outside institution with decompensated heart failure. His last measured ejection fraction was 29%.     In 01/04/2013, he was switched to everolimus (Afinitor) and has been taking denosumab for hypercalcemia and presumed bone metastases. The patient reports his most recent PET-CT at an outside facility, on 01/18/2013, was stable.     Today, Mr. Ecker presents accompanied by his wife. An MRI done yesterday shows worsening metastatic disease with interval development of at least 28 enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, as well as increased enhancement of the previously treated clival based lesion, though it is not noticeably larger.     Symptomatically, Mr. Ecker is doing well. His diplopia is stable, though he has had some unsteadiness for the past 2-3 weeks and had a fall 8 days ago, during which he sustained a laceration to his left hand. He saw his primary care physician last week and was given instructions to follow up in 1 week if it failed to heal. There is now significant swelling around the wound, involving his digits and extending up to the wrist. He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or other systemic symptoms. The area is nonpainful, and he has not lost any function or sensation in that hand.     Review Of Systems: A 14 point review of systems was negative, except as noted above in the HPI.     Social History: He resides with his wife in Visalia. He does not use tobacco and occasionally uses alcohol.     Medications:   1. Everolimus 10 mg p.o. daily.   2. Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.   3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.   4. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.a.m.   5. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.    6. Epogen injections weekly.   7. Folic acid supplement.   8. Synthroid 125 mcg daily.     Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 180/80, P 64. General: Well-appearing, healthy, robust gentleman in no acute distress KPS 90. HEENT: Head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Sclerae nonicteric. Hearing is grossly intact. Mucous membranes are moist. Neck is soft and supple. No adenopathy or thyromegaly. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate, rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Extremities: Warm and well perfused. On his left hand, on the volar aspect, just proximal to the 5th digit, is a 2 cm laceration with a modest amount of associated pus and swelling extending proximally to the wrist and distally involving his 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits. There is no warmth or pain. His strength and sensation are intact in this extremity. Neuro: Cranial nerves 2-12 are intact. There are no detectable abnormalities of his gaze. Strength and sensation are intact throughout, including in the left hand, as previously mentioned.     Imaging: MRI done yesterday, 03/07/2013, was independent reviewed by us and shows worsening metastatic disease with interval development of over a dozen new enhancing intraparenchymal lesions on the T1 post-contrast image. There is also increased enhancement without change in morphology of the previously treated clival based lesion. His previously treated left frontal, left parietal, and right temporal lobe intraparenchymal metastases are no longer visible. There is a significant amount of associated edema at multiple locations on the T2 FLAIR weighted images, but no mass effect.

The most recent MRI shows progression of the intracranial disease with numerous enhancing metastatic brain lesions, which are mostly subcentimeter though a few measure up to 1.5 cm in size. These lesions are too numerous to be treated with CyberKnife therapy, and we have therefore recommended whole brain radiation therapy to 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions. Given the relative radioresistence of this histology, we would reconsider radiosurgery boost of tumors that are not stabilized by whole brain irradiation at a later time.     The associated side effects of whole brain radiation include local alopecia, which is temporary, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. There is also the risk of further intracranial swelling, which can cause headache and neurologic symptoms. Post radiation somnolence syndrome is occasionally seen and usually resolves. There is a risk for neuro cognitive defects, especially memory and executive functions, endocrinopathies, and secondary cancers.     The edema associated with the parieto-occipital lesions is quite extensive.   However, given the absence  of mass effect and midline shift, we do not believe there is a surgical indication of these lesions. While our initial preference is to treat the edema with steroids; the left hand wound appears to be possibly infected and of immediate concern. Steroids in the context of this likely untreated infection could be dangerous. We have referred him to the Emergency Department for further evaluation and management of the left hand wound.     Mr. Ecker would prefer to receive the recommended radiotherapy closer to home near Visalia,CA and we agree that this is a reasonable decision.   We have referred him to,     Sequoia Regional Cancer Center   4945 W Cypress Ave, Visalia, CA 93277   Phone (559) 624-3100     We would like him to follow up with us in 2 months. He will have an MRI at that time.     Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient.   Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions or concerns.

Overall, he has been feeling significantly better and much stronger. He is on denosumab for his hypercalcemia, and started everolimus in late January. He says he is overall tolerating this well, but has some fatigue on it.     He says his breathing is much better at this point, that most of the time it is not limiting him.     He apparently had some diarrhea with everolimus and has been following with Dr. Legge, who has been closely following his labs and found and increase in his potassium, up to 6, and an increase in his creatinine up to 1.9 with a significant bump in his BUN as well to 88. In this context, Dr. Verdin stopped his potassium supplementation and benazepril, and he is instead on hydralazine and Imdur.     He denies any dizziness, syncope or presyncope, and is not currently having any diarrhea or other GI symptoms.     Current medications and physical examination are as documented in the Epic documentation below. Comprehensive review of systems was reviewed and is included in the clinic documentation.     Mr. Kipp had an echo performed today. This revealed normal LV size with systolic function at the lower limits of normal with an EF measured at 56%. He has mild mitral insufficiency and up to moderately severe tricuspid insufficiency with an RVSP of 45 mmHg based on right atrial pressure of 5. Compared to his prior study in December, the LV function has increased from 29% to 56%. The amount of TR and RVSP has increased from what was mild TR and RVSP of 25 mmHg.     Review of Mr. Gillam labs from 01/20/2025, include hemoglobin of 9.0, sodium 137, potassium 6.0, chloride 112, bicarbonate 19, BUN and creatinine  of 88 and 1.89 respectively. He then had followup labs on 01/24/2025 with a sodium of 137, potassium 5.2, BUN and creatinine of 77 and 1.8 respectively. I also have a report of an outside echo, performed at Kaweah Delta, which reported an EF of 61% with RVSP of 44 mmHg. In the physician interpretation as opposed to the measurement, it was noted that the EF looked more in the 40% to 45% range.     We interrogated Mr. Moitoso pacemaker today. Since 01/05/2025, he has had no atrial or ventricular arrhythmias recorded. He is 57% A sensed V sensed, and 43% A paced V sensed, in MVP mode with lower rate of 60.     Overall, I am pleased to see that Mr. Summers Robinette systolic function is so much better. Looking at the images, I suspect it is because he is no longer being RV paced, as he appeared quite dyssynchronous on his last echo when he was being paced, and on our check at that time, he had been 84% ventricularly paced, usually because of complete heart block. It actually is not clear to me why he has had improvement in his AV conduction, but clearly this is in his favor. Given this and given how much he has had an improvement in his EF, I am actually going to decrease his carvedilol from 12.5 mg b.i.d. to 6.25 mg b.i.d. to try to help with AV conduction, which is probably of more importance to him than being on a higher dose of carvedilol. Otherwise, I am not planning to make any changes and he will continue to follow up with his local nephrologist with close attention to his potassium and creatinine. I certainly concur with the decision to take him off benazepril and potassium supplementation and replace him with hydralazine and nitrates instead.     I will plan to have him come back at 4 months' time with an echo to make sure that his LV function has not once again declined in the setting of his current cancer therapy, as well as a pacer check at that time.     Thank you very much for allowing me to take part in  Mr. Kovac care. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Unless indicated otherwise, it has not been cleared or approved by the USFDA, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type.   OPERATION: Bilateral sphenoidotomy and biopsy.  CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Sinus cancer.  FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: FSA: Clivus, biopsy --   Focal atypical cells suspicious for a neoplastic process (Metcalf/McKenney) FS B: Clivus, biopsy #2 --   Additional lesional tissue obtained, defer to immunohistochemistry           (Metcalf/McKenney)  GROSS DESCRIPTION: Five specimens are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.  The first specimen labeled \"clival mass\" is received fresh and consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm tan-red soft tissue which is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSA) and not exhausted.  The frozen section residue is submitted in A1.  The second specimen labeled \"clival mass\" is received fresh and consists of two tan-red soft tissue fragments measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm.  A representative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis (FSB) and not exhausted.  The frozen section residue and remainder of the specimen is submitted in B1.  Breitweser (02/04/2011  The third specimen labeled \"clival mass\" is received in formalin and consists of multiple dark brown and pink hemorrhagic fragments of tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.  The specimen is entirely submitted between sponges in one cassette labeled C1.  The fourth specimen labeled \"right sinus contents\" is received in formalin and consists of multiple pink-tan fragments of soft tissue and bone measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm in aggregate.  Following decalcification the specimen is entirely submitted between sponges in one cassette labeled D1.  The fifth specimen labeled \"left sinus contents\" is received in formalin and consists of multiple tan pink fragments of bone and soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm in aggregate.  Following decalcification the specimen is entirely submitted between sponges in one cassette labeled E1.

The current specimens are involved by a carcinoma that is morphologically suggestive of a metastatic renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. Immunostains demonstrate immunoreactivity for CKMIX, PAX-2, and PAX-8 in the neoplastic cells, which also suggests a renal origin. Immunophenotypic subtyping is not 100% specific in carcinomas of unknown primary; therefore, the results must be interpreted in close correlation with the clinical findings and anticipated imaging results.  Dr. Squire spoke with Dr. Paull by phone on 02/09/2010 at 2:42PM to discuss the final diagnosis.  DIAGNOSIS: Clivus, biopsy --   involved by carcinoma (see comment) Clivus, #2, biopsy --   involved by carcinoma, MORPHOLOGICALLY and immunophenotypically suggestive of A RENAL PRIMARY (see comment) clivUS, #3, biopsy --   involved by carcinoma (see comment) Nasal area, right, ethmoidectomy --   involved by carcinoma (see comment) Nasal area, left, ethmoidectomy --   sinonasal mucosa with no tumor seen  metcalf/otanez/mckenney     I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

Delayed images through the kidneys were obtained. Images  were reformatted in the coronal and sagittal plane.  7 mm axial  maximal intensity projection images were reconstructed through the  chest.   CONTRAST: Omnipaque 350, 125 mL.     FINDINGS:   CHEST: The chest wall is unremarkable.     Mediastinum shows a solitary enlarged lymph node in the lower right  paratracheal mediastinum.  This has decreased in size in the prior  examination, currently measuring 1.9 x 1.0 cm (previously 2.4 x 3.8  cm).  There is a air fluid level in the midesophagus, and the mid and  distal esophagus in particular have a thick walled, irregular  appearance with prominent surrounding vessels suggesting hyperemia.   There are no pleural effusions or other pleural abnormalities.  The  central airways are patent.   The lungs exhibit a focal nodularity in the posterior aspect of the  right upper lobe that is somewhat difficult to compare to the prior  PET/CT given the difference of technique, but is in a probably  stable.  Satellite nodules and tree in bud opacity characterize this  abnormality and suggest this may be an inflammatory process.  There  is a isolated pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe (series 3  image number 91) that has dramatically decreased in size, now  measuring approximately 5 mm whereas previously this measured 13-mm.   Right lower lobe shows atelectasis and branching opacity posteriorly  (series 3 image number 197) that is probably unchanged from the prior  PET/CT.  Other areas of tree in bud opacity are scattered in the  right lower lobe, suggesting an inflammatory/infectious etiology.  A  3-mm pulmonary nodule is unchanged in the left upper lobe of lung.   Other scattered pulmonary nodules, some of which are calcified,  measured one to 2-mm.  Linear opacities in both lower lobes probably  reflect subsegmental atelectasis or pulmonary scarring.     No significant bony abnormalities are identified.  Degenerative  changes are noted in the right glenohumeral joint.     ABDOMEN/PELVIS: A heterogeneously enhancing right renal mass has decreased in size in  the prior exam, now measuring 3.6 x 5.1 cm whereas previously this  measured 6.2 x 7.4 cm.  The mass also has become less vascular and  has decreased solid components. The right renal vein is patent.  The  mass, although exophytic, is probably confined to the perirenal  space.  Mild thickening of the lateral Gerota fascia is noted however  immediately adjacent to the mass.  No retroperitoneal or mesenteric  lymphadenopathy is identified.   The liver shows fatty infiltration, and there is a small lesion in  the right hepatic lobe that shows discontinuous peripheral  enhancement suggesting a hemangioma.  This is not appear changed from  the prior exam.  The spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are normal.   Gallbladder has a somewhat thick walled appearance and shows mild  haziness in the pericholecystic fat.   Small low-density lesions in the left kidney are too small to  definitively characterize but probably reflect renal cysts.   The small bowel, appendix and colon are normal with exception of  scattered colonic diverticulosis.   The prostate is enlarged.  The urinary bladder is normal.   There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.   Unchanged lytic metastasis is noted in the left femoral head.   Otherwise bones are unremarkable.     IMPRESSION:   1.OVERALL IMPROVEMENT WITH DECREASED SIZE AND VASCULARITY OF PRIMARY  RIGHT RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, DECREASED SIZE OF RIGHT PARATRACHEAL  MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE, AND DECREASED SIZE OF SUSPECTED RIGHT UPPER  LOBE PULMONARY METASTASIS.   2.NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN CT APPEARANCE OF LYTIC METASTASIS IN THE  LEFT FEMORAL HEAD.   3.INTERVAL DEVELOPMENT OF ESOPHAGEAL WALL THICKENING AND  HYPERVASCULARITY, SUGGESTING ESOPHAGITIS, PERHAPS RELATED TO  CHEMOTHERAPY EFFECTS.   4.MILD HEPATIC STEATOSIS.   5.WALL THICKENING OF THE GALLBLADDER AND MILD PERICHOLECYSTIC  INFLAMMATORY CHANGES.  IN THE ABSENCE OF RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT  SYMPTOMATOLOGY, THIS MAY REFLECT RESPONSE TO THE ADJACENT HEPATITIS,  WHICH MAY BE ON THE BASIS OF CHEMOTHERAPY EFFECTS.  IF THERE IS ANY  CONCERN FOR ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS, RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND IS  RECOMMENDED.   6.MULTIPLE UNCHANGED PULMONARY NODULES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE A  INFECTIOUS/INFLAMMATORY APPEARANCE, AND OTHERS OF WHICH ARE  NONSPECIFIC.  ATTENTION ON SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION IS RECOMMENDED.

The  requisition and doctor's orders have been verified.    STUDY TYPE: Clinical study   PET SEQUENCE: Response to therapy   HISTOLOGY: Renal cell cancer   COMPARISON: PET/CT 01/14/2012; CT chest abdomen and pelvis 10/21/2011      CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old man with metastatic renal cell cancer.   Patient has a right kidney mass with mets to skull base, chest, left  femoral head/neck.  He has been treated by radiation to the femur in  03/04/2011. The nasopharyngeal/clivus/cavernous sinus metastasis,  left frontal metastasis, left parietal metastasis, and right temporal  metastasis were treated with CyberKnife on 02/17/2025 and 02/18/2025-4,  2011.  The patient began Sutent on 02/22/2011, and presents for  evaluation of response to therapy. The patient does not carry a diagnosis of diabetes.    ALLERGIES: no known drug allergies   RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: The patient was injected with 12 mCi of 18F-FDG.   The prescribed dose was 12 mCi IV.  The injection time was 08:12AM.   The IV injection site was right antecubital fossa.  The patient  voided prior to the start of imaging.  Imaging started at 09:03 AM  and ended at  09:33 AM.   PATIENT INFORMATION: Height is 5' 9\".  Weight is 84.6 kgs.  Blood  glucose level is 111 mg/dl.  The last meal was >12 hours ago.   Current liver SUV mean: 2.2.  Prior liver SUV mean: 1.9.  Current  right gluteal musculature SUV mean: 0.7.  Prior right gluteal  musculature SUV mean: 0.5.     PROCEDURE: 51 minutes after i.v. administration of the tracer  18F-FDG, images were acquired using the GE model 600 PET-CT scanner.   The imaged region parameters extend from vertex to mid thigh for use  in attenuation correction and anatomic localization of radiotracer  activity.  Emission scans were obtained over the same anatomical  regions.  Images were reconstructed and reviewed in the axial,  coronal, and sagittal planes.  For descriptive purposes, the maximum  standard uptake value (SUV max in g/mL) of metabolically active  tissues is reported, unless stated otherwise.  The patient was given  IV Lasix 40 mg.             FINDINGS:   HEAD AND NECK:  Limited evaluation of the brain demonstrates intense FDG uptake in  the visualized cerebral cortex gray matter.  This high physiologic  background activity reduces the sensitivity of PET for malignant  processes.  Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the salivary glands,  oropharynx, ocular muscles, and vocal cords. There are no  pathologically enlarged or hypermetabolic cervical or supraclavicular  lymph nodes.  The thyroid gland is unremarkable.  Mucosal thickening  of the ethmoid air cells and maxillary sinuses persistent.  Erosion  of the clivus and medial left temporal bone is redemonstrated, stable  in appearance and without increased FDG uptake.  Bilateral mastoid  effusions, without increased FDG uptake persist.  Mild diffuse uptake  is present in the scalp over the frontal bones bilaterally.     THORAX:   A 4-mm nodule in the anterior basal left lower lobe is new (locator  526), a 2-mm nodule is located just posteriorly in the same pulmonary  segment, (locator 526). Several nodular densities in the superior  segment of the right lower lobe shows a tree-in-bud appearance  suggestive of obstructed small airways, without increased FDG uptake,  and stable in comparison with the prior exam.  Ill-defined opacities  in the dependent inferior right lung base persists, compatible with  atelectasis.  Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the myocardium.   Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the left  anterior descending coronary artery.  No pericardial effusion.  Trace  pleural effusions are present bilaterally. The thoracic aorta and  main pulmonary artery are of normal caliber.  There are no  pathologically enlarged or hypermetabolic axillary, mediastinal, or  hilar lymph nodes.  A prominent appearing 8mm short axis precarinal  lymph node is stable and without increased FDG uptake.   ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the liver, spleen, and bowel.   The adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable on this limited  non-contrast CT.  The kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder are  visualized per clearance of the radiotracer.  A 2-cm lesion  projecting laterally from the mid to lower right kidney is unchanged  in size and continues to show no significant tracer accumulation, at  SUV max 2.3.  Intense signal from excreted tracer limits evaluation  for malignancy in the remainder of the urinary tract.  The abdominal  aorta is of normal caliber.  There are no pathologically enlarged or  hypermetabolic abdominal, pelvic, or inguinal lymph nodes.  A large  left-sided hydrocele is slightly further enlarged compared with the  prior scan.   MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the axial and proximal  appendicular skeleton.  Large lytic lesion in the posterior left  femoral head and neck, with rim sclerosis, is stable and do not show  increased FDG uptake.  Focal uptake in the proximal left vastus  lateralis persists, at SUV max 2.7, not changed when compare with 3.2  of the prior scan.  Diffuse soft tissue edema persist.     IMPRESSION:   1.  TWO NEW PULMONARY NODULES, BOTH LOCATED IN THE ANTERIOR BASAL  SEGMENT OF THE LEFT LOWER LOBE, MEASURING 4 and 2 MM , WHICH ARE  NONSPECIFIC AND MAY REFLECT A METASTATIC OR INFLAMMATORY PROCESS.   ATTENTION ON SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP CT IMAGING IS RECOMMENDED.   2.  NO EVIDENCE OF FDG AVID MALIGNANCY.  REDEMONSTRATION OF SEVERAL  SITES OF OSSEOUS METASTATIC DISEASE, INCLUDING THE LEFT PROXIMAL  FEMUR AND CLIVUS, WITHOUT INCREASED FDG UPTAKE, COMPATIBLE WITH  TREATED METASTASES   3.  SLIGHTLY INTERVAL ENLARGED LARGE LEFT HYDROCELE   4.  PERSISTENT NONSPECIFIC FOCAL UPTAKE IN THE ANTERIOR LEFT THIGH  MUSCULATURE, , LOCALIZING TO THE VASTUS LATERALIS, WHICH MAY REFLECT  INFLAMMATION.   SUMMARY: 4-POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTION.   PET SEQUENCE: RESPONSE TO TREATMENT: Complete response   A low radiation dose CT scan of the regions of interest was  performed, but was used only for attenuation correction and anatomic  correlation.

PROCEDURE: 44 minutes after i.v. administration of the tracer  18F-FDG, images were acquired. The imaging parameters were obtained  from Head and Neck (arms down) and base of skull to thighs (arms up).  for use in attenuation correction and anatomic localization of  radiotracer activity. Emission scans were obtained over the same  anatomical regions. Images were reconstructed and reviewed in the  axial, coronal, and sagittal planes.      FINDINGS:     HEAD AND NECK: Relative photopenia in the right temporal lobe is  likely related to prior radiation. There is expansion of the clivus  and petrous portions of the temporal bones bilaterally, with  opacification the mastoid air cells, complete on right, and partial  on the left. An approximate 1.7-cm mixed lytic lesion with adjacent  sclerotic rim erodes the clivus and extends into the left petrous  apex. Moderate uptake is present within this area of osteolysis and  soft tissue density, with SUV max 4.8 (locator 157), is decreased  from the previous of 7.3. The expansile soft tissue component  opacifying the sphenoid sinus and posterior ethmoid air cells are  decreased. Mild uptake is also present in the right external auditory  canal, with SUV max 3.9, that is likely inflammatory. Mild soft  tissue mucosal thickening of the interim maxillary sinuses  bilaterally is likely reactive. Evaluation of the right Meckel's cave  is limited by high FDG signal by adjacent brain parenchyma. There is  no definite increased uptake within the right clivus. It uptake in  the mucosal space of the left nasopharynx is slightly increased to  SUV max 4.0 which may be inflammatory.     Limited evaluation of the brain demonstrates intense FDG uptake in  the visualized cerebral cortex gray matter. This high physiologic  background activity reduces the sensitivity of PET for malignant  processes. Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the salivary glands,  oropharynx, ocular muscles, and vocal cords. There are no  pathologically enlarged or hypermetabolic cervical or supraclavicular  lymph nodes. The thyroid gland is unremarkable.     THORAX: Small cluster of nodules in the posterior right upper lobe  without FDG uptake is stable (locator 166.9. 6-mm nodule in the  superior left lower lobe has resolved. Ill-defined bandlike opacities  in the dependent right lower lobe likely correspond to atelectasis.  Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the myocardium. The previously  enlarged a 4 x 2.3 cm right paratracheal node is decreased in size to  0.8 x 1.6 cm, now with SUV max 1.8, compared to SUV max 6.6  previously. There are no pathologically enlarged or hypermetabolic  axillary or hilar lymph nodes.     ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the liver,  spleen, and bowel. Exophytic ill-defined soft tissue reflecting the  known RCC projecting from the lateral right kidney is interval  decreased in size and FDG uptake now measuring 3.2 x 4 .3 cm, SUV max  2.7, as compared with 4 x 6.3-cm and SUV max 5.8 previously. The  right kidney, ureters, and urinary bladder are visualized per normal  clearance of the radiotracer. High FDG background limits evaluation  of other urinary tract lesions. The adrenal glands and pancreas are  unremarkable on this limited non-contrast CT. There are no  pathologically enlarged or hypermetabolic abdominal, pelvic, or  inguinal lymph nodes. Scattered subcentimeter non-FDG avid  retroperitoneal lymph nodes are stable. A moderate-sized left-sided  hydrocele is present. There is stable mild aneurysmal dilatation of  the infrarenal aorta, measuring up to 2.8-cm in maximal diameter..     MUSCULOSKELETAL: The predominantly lytic lesion in the posterior  left femoral head and neck is stable in size and now shows background  FDG uptake with SUV max 1.3 with increased rim sclerosis, reflecting  reparative response. Ill-defined hypermetabolic soft tissue in the  left rectus femoris shows interval decreased FDG uptake now with SUV  max 3.2, down from 7.6 previously. Slight increased lucencies in the  ilia are diffuse, non-FDG avid, and are likely related to osteopenia.  Overall soft tissue edema are slightly increased.         IMPRESSION:     1. OVERALL PARTIAL FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO THERAPY AS ASSESSED BY  LESION SIZES AND FDG AVIDITY. THE RIGHT KIDNEY PRIMARY, LEFT FEMORAL  METASTASIS, AND RIGHT PARATRACHEAL NODE SHOW COMPLETE METABOLIC  RESPONSE. SEVERAL PULMONARY NODULES HAVE RESOLVED. RESIDUAL MILD FDG  UPTAKE IN THE LEFT RECTUS FEMORIS SOFT TISSUE MASS AND CLIVAL LESIONS  PERSIST.     2. ALTHOUGH EVALUATION IS LIMITED BY HIGH SIGNAL FROM ADJACENT BRAIN  PARENCHYMA, NO DEFINITE INCREASE IN RIGHT CLIVAL FDG UPTAKE, IN THE  REGION OF INCREASED ENHANCEMENT SEEN ON RECENT MR.     SUMMARY: 2-ABNORMAL, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED     PET SEQUENCE: Response to therapy: Partial response     A whole body CT scan was performed, but was used only for  attenuation correction and anatomic correlation.

FINDINGS: Please note this is a stereotactic MRI obtained for the  purpose of surgical localization demonstrating an abnormal enhancing  mass-like tissue extending posteriorly from the midline nasopharynx  into the mid-to-left clivus and left sphenoid bone. This is  aggressive in appearance and suggestive of associated bony  destruction. Abnormal enhancement and tissue is identified within the  posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses with associated partial  erosive changes. A somewhat well-circumscribed, rounded lesion is  identified in the region of the right fossa of Rosenmller with  minimal, if any, associated enhancement. This may be unrelated to the  above-mentioned aggressive erosive changes of the clivus and skull  base and is grossly unchanged from prior study. At least 3 intraaxial  foci of enhancement are identified within the brain, including a 5-mm  focus of enhancement within the right temporal lobe (see image 26 of  series 4), an 8-mm focus of enhancement within the left frontal lobe  (see images 20 of series 4), and a 4-mm focus of enhancement within  the left parietal lobe (see image 7 of series 4).

Axial, coronal, and sagittal T1 whole brain post  contrast.   FINDINGS: Abnormal marrow replacement is again seen involving the  skull base, largely centered on the clivus with abnormal signal  extending into both petrous apices.  There has been an interval  increase in marrow replacing abnormal soft tissue, particularly in  the right side of the clivus (reference image 11 series 11 compared  with prior image 9 series 9).  There is also a greater volume of  marrow replacement in the dorsum sella, bilateral petrous apices, and  pterygoids.  These findings are associated with mild interval  increase in enhancement in these regions.  The asymmetric enhancement  and soft tissue in the left cavernous sinus does not appear  remarkably different from prior study.  Similar asymmetry in the  right cavernous sinus and Meckel's cave also appear stable. As  before, there is no finding to suggest intraorbital extension or  direct intracranial extension.  The bilateral mastoid effusions have  significantly progressed compared to prior study.  Extensive mucosal  thickening in the sphenoid, ethmoid and maxillary sinuses is again  seen.  The right nasopharyngeal lesion with a bilobed configuration  and intrinsic hyperintense T1 signal appear stable.   Redemonstration of small enhancing foci in the left frontal and left  parietal lobes which appear slightly smaller compared with prior  study.

Blood  glucose level is 117 mg/dl.   PROCEDURE: Approximately 60 minutes after i.v. administration of  18F-FDG, a non-contrast CT was obtained from the vertex to the upper  thighs for use in attenuation correction and anatomic localization of  radiotracer activity. Emission scans were obtained over the same  anatomical regions. Images were reconstructed and reviewed in the  axial, coronal, and sagittal planes.   FINDINGS:   HEAD AND NECK:    Limited evaluation of the brain demonstrates intense FDG uptake in  the visualized cerebral cortex gray matter.

Best seen on MRI from 02/03/2011, there is an aggressive soft tissue  mass centered in the midline of the nasopharynx, with extension  superiorly into the mid to left aspect of the clivus (with associated  bony destruction), as well as into the sphenoid sinus (with  destruction of the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus).  This mass  lesion demonstrates FDG avidity (SUV 9.1).   Similar to MRI, there is soft tissue fullness in the right fossa of  Rosenmuller (2/50), without any associated FDG avidity.   There is opacification of the left maxillary sinus (2/53), distant  from the primary abnormality in the nasopharynx, with mild FDG  avidity (SUV 3.0), likely inflammatory in nature.   There is otherwise normal FDG activity in the mylohyoid muscles, the  sublingual glands, the salivary glands, and within the mucosal space  of the pharynx. No other pathologic FDG uptake is identified within  the neck.   There are no enlarged or FDG avid lymph nodes in either cervical  chain or supraclavicular space.   Visualized portions of the thyroid are normal in appearance, without  evidence of a discrete nodule or mass.  There is no abnormal FDG  uptake in the thyroid.     THORAX:    Heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion or  significant coronary artery atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is  normal FDG uptake in the left ventricular myocardium.

There is a 74 x 69 x 84 mm FDG avid soft tissue mass arising off the  mid pole of the right kidney (2/130) (SUV 10.1).  The majority of  this mass does demonstrate avid FDG uptake, although there are some  photopenic areas within this mass, likely representing areas of  necrosis.  There is no hydronephrosis or stone, and there is normal  excretion of FDG into the right collecting system and ureter.   There is a small hiatal hernia.  The stomach and duodenum are in  normal anatomic positions.  Small bowel loops are normal in caliber,  with normal physiologic FDG uptake.  The colon is normal in  appearance, without evidence of wall thickening or diverticulitis.   The terminal ileum and appendix are normal in appearance in the right  lower quadrant.   There are no significantly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes in  the abdomen, or perinephric lymph nodes.  There are no enlarged or  FDG avid lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis.   The bladder is normal in appearance, without evidence of wall  thickening, mass, or stone.  There is normal FDG uptake in the  bladder.  The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal in appearance.

This mass demonstrates smooth and  well-defined margins.  It demonstrates intrinsic T1 hyperintensity  and T2 hyperintensity as well as partial enhancement on  postgadolinium images.  In the axial plane, this lesion is bilobed  with the larger more superior lobe protruding into the right lateral  nasopharynx, measuring on the order of 1.1 x 1.7 cm in transaxial  dimension (series 7 image 7).  The more inferior lobe extends along  the lateral pharynx into the oropharynx for a distance of  approximately 3 cm (series 8 image 7).  This lesion appears  submucosal in location.  It approaches the right distal cervical  internal carotid artery but does not frankly contact the vessel.  The  aeroalimentary tract is widely patent in this region.   With regards to intracranial contents, there are three enhancing  lesions within the supratentorial brain.  The dominant lesion in the  left frontal lobe is associated with vasogenic edema and localized  mass effect.  Smaller enhancing foci are seen within the right  temporal lobe and left parietal lobe.  Findings are concerning for  metastatic disease.   With regards to cranial nerves, no asymmetry nor focal abnormality is  noted.  However, cranial nerves are seen to extend through the  infiltrated left cavernous sinus as well as thickened retroclival  dura.   No definite perineural spread is identified.  There is asymmetric  enhancement within the left infratemporal fossa and masticator space,  probably vascular in origin.   No lymphadenopathy is identified within the neck.  The few scattered  nonspecific subcentimeter lymph nodes are seen bilaterally.   Signal abnormalities within the anteromedial left axillary sinus  (series 7 image 7), remote from previously described lesions in the  right nasopharynx, clivus, and sphenoid sinus are probably congestive  or inflammatory in nature.   Visualized portions of the lung apices and superior mediastinum are  without focal abnormality to stress metastatic disease to these  regions.     IMPRESSION:   1.  Nodular soft tissue mass extending posteriorly from the midline  nasopharynx into and replacing the majority of the mid to left clivus  and infiltrating the sphenoid sinus.   2.  Additional submucosal lesion centered in the right fossa of  Rosenm?ller extending inferiorly along the lateral pharynx into the  oropharynx.  Signal characteristics of this lesion suggests that it  is unrelated to the aggressive lesion previously described.  Finding  may represent an incidental mucous retention cyst or other  proteinaceous fluid collection.   3.  Multiple intracranial enhancing lesions are worrisome for  metastatic disease.

ATTENDING PRESENCE: Gloria Hwang, the attending physician, was  present and actively participated in all aspects of the procedure.   TECHNIQUE:  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed and  informed consent was obtained.  Prior to the start of the procedure,  Universal Protocol steps were performed to confirm the patient's  identity, planned procedure, and all personnel in the room.  To  achieve maximum barrier protection against sepsis, caps, masks, hand  hygiene, sterile gloves, sterile gowns, a large sterile drape, and 2%  Chlorhexidine scrub were all used according to protocol.  The scrub  duration was at least 30 seconds and the CHG was allowed to dry.   1% lidocaine was injected into the right lateral chest wall.  Under  ultrasound the area was accessed with a 5-French micropuncture set.   A 6-French drain was exchanged for the set over an Amplatz wire.  The  wire was removed and the drain was placed to suction.  Over the  course of two hours 3700 cc of light red pleural effusion removed.  A  chest x-ray was performed which showed no pneumothorax.  The chest  tube was removed and the patient was discharged.   FINDINGS:  3.7 liters of light red pleural fluid removed.     IMPRESSION:   1.  SUCCESSFUL THORACENTESIS   PLAN:    There was no difficulty gaining IV access. The medication totals  were: micrograms Fentanyl, milligrams Versed, local anesthesia with  1% Lidocaine.  In the future, general anesthesia will not be  necessary.  An interpreter was not  required. There were no other  issues.
